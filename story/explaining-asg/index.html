With this explainer, NBN hopes to change that.&nbsp;</em><em>This article will be continually updated by NBN News to reflect ASG's history, recent trends in ASG news, and changes to ASG's structure. It'll be like Wikipedia for ASG, but written and maintained by NBN's reporters.</em></p><p><em>As always, share your thoughts about this explainer &ndash; or what you'd like to see explained in the future &ndash; in the comments</em><em>.</em></p><p>The Associated Student Government is the official student government of the Northwestern University undergraduate population.</p><p>ASG discusses and enacts improvements to Northwestern University programs and allocates the annual $1.3 million <a href="../breakdown-of-asg-funding-to-campus-groups/index.html">Student Activities Fee to campus student groups</a>.</p><p>ASG members can be either elected or appointed. The three branches of ASG are the Executive Board, the Senate and the 14 standing committees. Additionally, there are two associate vice presidents who also oversee committees.</p><p>ASG keeps a <a href="http://asg.northwestern.edu/docs/asg-handbook_2012-2013.pdf">handbook</a> detailing its policies.</p><div id="executive_board"><div style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>EXECUTIVE BOARD</strong></div><p>The Executive Board manages ASG as a whole and directly communicates with the University administration and other administrative discussions. Executive members conceive of the majority of ASG&rsquo;s projects. The Executive Board attends Senate each week and meets regularly on its own.</p><div id="Exec_Membership"><strong>Membership</strong></div><p>The Executive Board comprises 14 members, each charged with a specific function. Some, but not all, oversee one of ASG&rsquo;s 10 <a href="index.html#committees">idea-based committees.</a></p><p>Four Executive Board members are selected through the annual campus-wide ASG election during spring quarter. The <strong>p</strong><strong>resident</strong>, currently <a href="../shao-and-stewart-ride-to-victory-in-run-off-electi/index.html">Victor Shao</a>, presides over the Executive Board and oversees ASG.

Appointments are confirmed by the Senate. The <strong>public relations vice president</strong> (currently Becca Rodriguez), <strong>community relations vice president</strong> (currently Steven Monacelli), <strong>technology vice president</strong> (Ethan Romba) and <strong>services vice president</strong> (David Harris) each chair their respective committees. The new position <strong>chief of staff</strong> is also a Cabinet position and is currently Carly Blumenfeld.</p><p>Four Executive positions make up the <strong>Parliamentary Body</strong>, which is elected by the Senate.

The <strong>parliamentarian</strong>, currently Brandon McNamara, serves as head of Committee on the Rules, takes roll at Senate meetings and interprets and upholds the rules. The <strong>treasurer,</strong> currently David Chi, maintains ASG financial accounts and administers the operating budget.</p><p><strong>Financial vice president</strong> (Girish Pendse) and <strong>student groups vice president</strong> (Lauren Masterson) are appointed by a selection committee that consists of committee members, Executive Board members and faculty advisors.

Natalie Furlett, director of the Center for Student Involvement, and Director of Undergraduate Studies Mark Witte currently hold these positions.</p></div><div id="senate" style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>SENATE</strong></div><div>ASG Senate is Northwestern&rsquo;s official student legislative body. It convenes weekly and votes on bills, which can be written by both ASG members and non-member undergraduates.</div><br /><div id="#legislation"><strong>Legislation</strong></div>
The Senate deals with six different types of legislation:
<ul><li><strong>Senate legislation</strong>, a bill of general interest to the undergraduate community and requires ASG action;</li><li><strong>Senate resolution</strong>, which expresses ASG Senate&rsquo;s verbal support for an issue that requires no ASG action;</li><li><strong>financial resolution</strong>, a bill that allocates funds from the ASG Activities fee or the ASG operating budget;</li><li><strong>constitutional amendment</strong>, amending or modifying the ASG Constitution; and</li><li><strong>joint amendment</strong>, a bill that amends or modifies both the ASG Constitution and Bylaws.</li></ul><div id="membership"><br /><strong>Membership</strong></div>
Senate consists of 51 representatives, who each belong to one of four themed caucuses. Each caucus elects a whip, who speaks on behalf of the group during Senate meetings. Caucuses meet weekly, separate from Senate, to discuss issues that pertain only to their respective constituents.
<p>The <strong>Residential Hall Association and Residential College Board Caucus</strong> contains 10 RHA and five RCB senators, who are elected via dorm elections during fall quarter. The current whip is Lauren Johnson.</p><p>The <strong>Greek Caucus</strong> consists of five senators from the Interfraternity Council, five from Panhellenic Association and one from each culturally-based Greek council, the Multicultural Greek Council and National Pan-Hellenic Council. These senators are chosen by their respective Greek executive boards via an application and interview process during spring quarter. Any Greek-affiliated member may apply, but no two senators can belong to the same chapter. The current Greek caucus whip is Sarah Brock.&nbsp;</p><p>The <strong>Off-Campus Caucus</strong> comprises eight senators, who are selected through an application process by a special committee of Executive Board members. The current off-campus caucus whip is Ian Coley.</p><p>The <strong>Student Group Caucus </strong>contains 16 representatives from various campus groups, who apply each year for Senate seats, with the exception of the Student Athletic Advisory Council who has a permanent seat. Clubs are encouraged to combine with similar-minded groups when applying for seats. The current student group caucus whip is Paul Koscumb.</p><p>The following student organization groupings hold Senate seats for the 2012-2013 school year:</p><ul><ul><li><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/isa/?p=2005"><span class="s4">Alianza</span></a></li><li><a href="http://www.aoproductions.net/">A&amp;O Productions</a>, <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/mayfest/">Mayfest</a> and <a href="http://niteskoolmusic.com/">Niteskool</a></li><li><a href="http://aponorthwestern.org/">Alpha Phi Omega</a> and <a href="http://www.nuscno.org/">Students Consulting Non-Profit Organizations</a> (SCNO)</li><li><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/feminists/">College Feminists</a></li><li class="li4"><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/nucr/">College Republicans</a></li><li class="li4"><a href="http://northwestern.collegiatelink.net/organization/formembersonly">For Members Only</a> (FMO)</li><li><a href="http://www.nuhillel.org/">Hillel</a></li><li><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/kasa/">Korean American Students Association</a>(KASA), <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/tasc/">Taiwanese American Students Club</a> (TASC) and <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/csa/">Chinese Students Association</a> (CSA)</li><li><a href="http://www.ncdcnorthwestern.org/">Northwestern Community Development Corps</a> (NCDC)</li><li>Peace Project, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP)</li><li><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/rainbow/home.php">Rainbow Alliance</a></li><li><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/sasa/">South Asian Student Alliance</a> (SASA), <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/mcsa/">Muslim-cultural Student Association</a> (McSA) and <a href="http://northwestern.collegiatelink.net/organization/pars">Persian American Representatives of Students&nbsp;</a> (PARS)</li><li><a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/seed/">Students for Ecological and Environmental Development</a> (SEED)</li><li><a href="http://nustudenttheatre.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" nu="" student="" theatre="" coalition="" a=""> StuCo</a></li><li><a href="http://www.nusports.com/ot/nw-saac.html">Student-Athlete Advisory Committee</a> (SAAC)</li></ul></ul><p></p><div id="committees"><div style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>COMMITTEES</strong></div><p>The 14 ASG standing committees contain both Senators and non-Senators, who apply for positions during fall quarter and throughout the year as needed.
