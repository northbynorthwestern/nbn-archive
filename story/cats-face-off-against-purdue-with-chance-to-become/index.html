The &#8216;Cats (6-1, 2-1 Big Ten) annihilated the Boilermakers (2-5, 0-3) and looked great doing it. From the beginning to the end the team made big plays that let them control the momentum. The defense recorded three interceptions and forced a fumble. Bacher bounced back from a rough outing last week with three touchdown passes. Sutton rushed for 96 yards and also had 4 receptions for 62 yards. And if that wasn&#8217;t exciting enough, Eric Peterman threw a touchdown pass. With the win Northwestern did what it failed to do last week: prove that they are definitely in the upper echelon of the Big Ten along with MSU, OSU, Minnesota and, of course, PSU.</p><p><strong>End of regulation: Purdue 26 Northwestern 48</strong></p><p>5:55 4Q: Purdue recovers an onside kick after a 76 yard touchdown run by Kory Sheets cuts the lead to 48-26. But, the black and gold celebration is short lived. Painter goes for the home run ball and is picked by NU corner Sherrick McManis, who was the Cat who forced the turnover on the last Purdue drive. Painter had no choice but to through into double coverage.<br /><strong>Purdue 26 Northwestern 48</strong></p><p>6:21 4Q: It&#8217;s Groundhog Day. The &#8216;Cats get another turnover, on a fumble by Orton which was recovered by Brian Peters, and again punch it in on a 14 yard Conteh touchdown run.<br /><strong>Purdue 19 Northwestern 48<br /></strong><br />
7:23 4Q: Northwestern converts the interception into another touchdown, this time a 1 yard keeper by Bacher. If the &#8216;Cats play like the way they have in the second half of this game they will definitely be a tough out for Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois and should even be competitive against Ohio St. As last week shows, a mediocre NU can not beat the conference&#8217;s elites. But, Northwestern is a good team and at its best can dominate the Big Ten&#8217;s mid-range teams.<br /><strong>Purdue 19 Northwestern 41<br /></strong><br />
8:11 4Q: Another great play for the defense. Freshman corner back Jordan Mabin picks off a Painter pass and runs it all the way back to the Purdue 1. Mabin is one of the fastest players on the team and he showed it on the 38 yard return where he went sideline to sideline.</p><p>8:46 4Q: Villarreal misses a chip shot 25 yard field goal that would have given NU a 37-19 lead but the offense still takes a lot of time off the clock with another long drive. The offense will not have to hear about how they are under performing this week. All facets of the offense have been clicking, with even backup running back Omar Conteh getting in on the action with several long runs.</p><p>14:52 4Q: Purdue strikes back with a long Painter touchdown pass down the middle of the field to Orton. Safety Brad Phillips was late getting to the play and left the receiver in single coverage.<br /><strong>Purdue 19 Northwestern 34</strong></p><p><strong>End of the 3rd Quarter: Purdue 12 Northwestern 34</strong></p><p>1:44 3Q: This game is officially a rout. Bacher gets his 3rd touchdown pass on the day, a one yard pass to Brendan Mitchell in the back corner of the end zone. The defense gave the offense great position as a hit by Corey Wootton on Painter led to an easy interception by Brad Phillips. One more score and maybe Fitz can get Mike Kafka into the game.<br /><strong>Purdue 12 Northwestern 34</strong></p><p>9:57 3Q: Northwestern carries the momentum over from the first half and on their opening drive get a Villarreal field goal. The drive was highlighted by a 26 yard screen pass to Sutton along with several nice rushes by Bacher. With such a big lead, it appears that the offense is content to call risk-free runs and screen passes. Why not. The screen passes keep the clock moving and ideally suit running back Tyrell Sutton, who now leads all NU running backs in terms of receiving yards.<br /><strong>Purdue 12 Northwestern 27</strong></p><p>Second Half Analysis: Overall, a strong first half for NU. Several big plays have enabled them to control the game. Bacher&#8217;s play was inconsistent at first but he has played much better as the game has gone along. Since the interception he has thrown two touchdown passes and overall has completed 11 passes for 156 yards. He has been helped by the fact that the middle of the field has been open all day. Bacher also has 5 rushes for 21 yards. The star, however, has been Eric Peterman, who has both a touchdown catch and pass. The team looks well on its way to improving to 6-1.</p><p><strong>End of second half: Purdue 12 Northwestern 24</strong></p><p>:15 2Q: After Purdue seized the momentum, NU comes and takes it right back. Getting the ball with just over a minute left they march down the field and then score a touchdown on a 9 yard Bacher pass to Tyrell Sutton. They were helped out by two big Purdue penalties. Two marks of a good team are taking advantages of opponents&#8217; miscues and quickly responding to touchdowns so you really have to like what NU did on that last drive.<br />
Purdue 12 Northwestern 24</p><p>1:09 2Q: Sheets bounces to the outside and into the end zone to get the Boilermakers back in the game. Purdue missed the extra point so the score is 17-12 NU. Purdue quarterback Curtis Painter returned and looked much better, completing a nice 24 yard pass to Greg Orton to set up the touchdown run.<br /><strong>Purdue 12 Northwestern 17<br /></strong><br />
2:52 2Q: Well, the only thing that could have shifted the mo backs towards Purdue was a NU turnover and the Boilermakers get what they need by recovering an unforced Sutton fumble. If the Boilermakers can score they will be right back in it and will start the second half on a high.</p><p>6:10 2Q: Purdue keeps Joey Elliott out to start the drive. It appears as if Curtis Painter, who was getting Heisman consideration at the beginning of the year, has been benched.</p><p>9:54 2Q: Unfortunately, Northwestern misses a chance to put the game away, as much as you can in the first half, and has to settle for a field goal. Nevertheless, this is exactly the momentum changing offensive blitz NU has been looking for all year. It is the type of flurry MSU used at the beginning of last week&#8217;s game to really establish the tone and take all of the energy out of the Wildcats.<br /><strong>Purdue 6 Northwestern 17</strong></p><p>10:46 2Q: Purdue&#8217;s new quarterback, Joey Elliott, botches a snap. NU recovers and will take over at the Purdue 10. It&#8217;s still the first half, but if they score a touchdown here they will really have a strangle hold on this game.</p><p>10:57 2Q: Most exciting play of the season! Peterman does his best Kordell Stewart impression and hits a wide open Sidney Stewart in the end zone for the touchdown. Nothing changes the momentum like those trick plays and now the &#8216;Cats look to be firmly in control. With a touchdown pass and reception, Peterman is already having the game of his life.<br /><strong>Purdue 6 Northwestern 14 </strong></p><p>11:26 2Q: That rap song written about NU&#8217;s football team has to rank up there with Juicy, Changes, and Jay-Z&#8217;s Allure.</p><p>13:56 2Q: Bacher completes a screen pass to Peterman, who breaks a few tackles, gets a few blocks, and rumbles about 40 yards after the catch for a Wildcats&#8217; touchdown. Northwestern takes the lead, 7-6. Purdue was hit hard at the 5 by two Purdue defenders but still managed to make it into the end zone.<br /><strong>Purdue 6 Northwestern 7 </strong></p><p><strong>End of 1st Quarter: Purdue 6 Northwestern 0</strong></p><p>:28 1Q: Purdue turns the NU turnover into more points with another field goal to make the score 6-0. On 3rd and 3, Painter overthrew a fade pass deep into the end zone, letting NU&#8217;s defense off the hook. With the way Sheets is playing, I would have just given him the ball.<br /><strong>Purdue 6 Northwestern 0<br /></strong><br />
2:34 1Q: Bacher throws another interception to bring his season total to nine. To make matters worse, the &#8216;Cats were in field goal range after Tyrell Sutton executed a series of successful runs. Going into the season Bacher was supposed to be a solid anchor on offense. Well, he is, but in the sense that he is holding the ship back.</p><p>4:42 1Q: Purdue kicks a field goal to draw first blood. It is pretty obvious that they key player for Purdue is not quarterback Curtis Painter but running back Kory Sheets. They big play on the drive was a 25 yard run by Sheets and he also got the Boilermakers in field goal range with a first down run on a 3rd and 1.   <strong>Purdue 3 Northwestern O</strong></p><p>10:24 1Q: The &#8216;Cats are forced to punt after not convert on third down during what seemed like a promising drive. Although NU did not come away with points, fans should take solace in the fact that Bacher looks pretty good early. He really managed the last drive, spreading the ball to several receivers with short, quick completions. When no one was open threw the ball away instead of forcing a throw and risking an interception.</p><p>Kickoff: Purdue wins the toss and elects to receive. Purdue returns the ball 28 yards and will start on the 32 yard line.</p><p>Pregame Notes: This could be the most important game Northwestern will play for the rest of the season. With only one remaining cupcake left on the schedule (next week against Indiana) the &#8216;Cats must win this game if they hope to return to a bowl game for the first time since 2005. Otherwise, to make a bowl NU would have to win a road game at Minnesota or Michigan or pull of an upset at home against Illinois.</p><p>While Purdue has lost three in a row and has underachieved this season, history says that this could be a difficult match up for NU. Purdue has won two in a row against the Wildcats and ten of the two teams&#8217; last twelve meetings.</p><p>The Boilermakers are coming off a 16-3 loss in Columbus to Ohio State. In that game, Purdue&#8217;s defense played outstanding, limiting the Buckeyes offense to 222 yards of total offense. The offense, however, struggled. Purdue&#8217;s offense was supposed to be the team&#8217;s strong point but this has not been the case. The Boilermakers have amassed just nine points in their last two games and quarterback Curtis Painter has thrown more interceptions than touchdowns.</p><p>Unfortunately, it appears that last week&#8217;s loss against Michigan State did take a toll on the enthusiasm for this week&#8217;s game. With just fifteen minutes until game time the student section is less than half full.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
