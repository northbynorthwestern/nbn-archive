He was having a good time until he told the man he was Jewish.</p><p>&ldquo;He went on this whole long tirade about how he hated Israel and he felt that Hitler had the right ideas, but only with Israel and not with the Jews,&rdquo; Toubman said. &ldquo;And that made me super uncomfortable and I had to leave.&rdquo;</p><p>A few weeks later, some students from the program took a trip to Israel. When they crossed the border, Toubman said he felt like he was going home.</p><p>When he tried to meet up with his group in the West Bank a few days later, his taxi driver kept warning him that it would not be safe.</p><p>&ldquo;He started accusing me of being a traitor,&rdquo; Toubman said. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Do you hate Israel? Who are you? This, Israel, is us versus them. It&rsquo;s the Jews versus the Palestinians.'&rdquo;</p><p>An &ldquo;exorbitant taxi fare&rdquo; later, Toubman finally met up with his friends and headed back to Jordan. Along the way, they stopped at a fruit stand in the mountains of Palestine and paused to talk.</p><p>&ldquo;Really in the end, I realized that is what Israel is supposed to be,&rdquo; Toubman said. &ldquo;We were just there, existing as humans and that is what Israel means to me.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Tomer Cherki, Weinberg freshman</strong></p><p>Cherki shared his story through three major themes: cursing, ice cream and football. To begin, he talked about some of his &ldquo;personal curses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My family has had to migrate from one place to another ... time and time again because of religious persecution,&rdquo; Cherki said. Growing up, he said he was taught to hide his Jewish background.</p><p>&ldquo;I was bullied as a child,&rdquo; Cherki said. &ldquo;People would chase me around with a picture of a crucified, bloody Jesus saying &lsquo;Look what you did!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>According to Cherki, Israel is the one place he doesn&rsquo;t have to hide his origins, &rdquo;and they have great ice cream.&rdquo;</p><p>Cherki recounted waited in line for the treat before the start of a football game when warning sirens began to sound, signaling incoming Katyusha rockets from Gaza. As he headed to the closest shelter, Israeli forces launched a defense missile in return, which collided with the rocket directly.</p><p>&ldquo;When they met, there was a giant explosion that sent sparks dancing across the sky and I just stopped and looked,&rdquo; Cheri said.</p><p>After leaving the shelter, Cherki said, his family was still excited for the game, even though their ice cream had melted. However, once halftime began, another red alert began.</p><p>Finding the timing strange, Cherki said, &ldquo;All of a sudden it clicked for all of us: the terrorists were watching the game too.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Noah Perkins, School of Communication junior</strong></p><p>When Perkins visited Auschwitz during the International March of the Living, a two week trip to Poland and Israel for Jewish teenagers, he said he felt empty.</p><p>&ldquo;I felt there was something wrong with me,&rdquo; Perkins said. &ldquo;I walked into a gas chamber and I walked out and still, yet, I did not cry.&rdquo;</p><p>When he got back to the bus, he stumbled upon the story of a man who refused to be parted with his tefillin when he arrived at the camp and was beaten to death.</p><p>&ldquo;That was the moment that I cried, not because of what had happened to this person, but because I did not know what tefillin were,&rdquo; Perkins said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what he died for, and so I wept.&rdquo;</p><p>Determined to learn, Perkins approached the rabbi on the trip who explained to him the significance of the leather prayer boxes. Perkins then recruited the rabbi to help him buy a set of his own once they got to Israel. In Jerusalem, they went to a shop ran by a scribe named Ezra.</p><p>&ldquo;He told me that what I was doing was a great mitzvah ... because I was choosing to do this not because of what others did,&rdquo; Perkins said.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
