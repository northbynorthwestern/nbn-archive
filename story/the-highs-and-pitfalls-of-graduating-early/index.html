The &#8220;best four years&#8221; of your life, drawing to a close. Checklist: hang out with friends, bleed purple at football games and train for your last Dillo Day. </p><p>That&#8217;s not the case for Weinberg junior Zachary Pope, though. Pope plans to spend his senior year in Latin America working with a non-governmental organization before heading to medical school. He says he has no desire to get a job quite yet and would rather spend his year helping people. “I want to feel like I changed the world as much as I could given my education and the one year I have free,” he says.</p><div class="quote_box">“I had to keep up with what was coming up next. I never felt like I was permanently a part of Northwestern. I was always just passing through.”</div><p>Pope is just one of many Northwestern students planning to graduate early. Each year, students finish early for a variety of reasons &#8212; one of the biggest reasons is financial savings.</p><p>Hannah Fraser-Chanpong, a Medill senior who is graduating a quarter early, says saving a quarter’s worth of tuition was worth leaving Northwestern early. “I would love to spend all of the time in the world and all of the money in the world on classes,” she says. “But not everyone can do that. I think that in the interest of saving money, it works better for me.”  </p><p>College was constantly stressful for William Krause (Comm &#8216;10), who could only afford Northwestern if he graduated after his junior year. “I had to make sure far in advance that I knew exactly what [classes] I was going to take and when I was going to take it,” he says. “I had to keep up with what was coming up next. I never felt like I was permanently a part of Northwestern. I was always just passing through.”<br />
 <br />
Pope believes that knowing he was graduating early made him take advantage of everything Northwestern offers, including attending guest lecturers and peer discussions, never missing a football game and buying tickets to all of A&#038;O’s productions. “You are only in college once, and when you are graduating early, you truly appreciate the opportunities [it] brings,” Pope says.<br />
 <br /><center> * * * </center></p><p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>Graduating more than one quarter early</span></strong> requires extensive planning, including mapping out classes far in advance, which usually begins during freshman year or even earlier. “It doesn’t allow you to make any mistakes with course selections,” says Keri Disch, Medill’s director of student services.  “You have to be on top of it. You can’t take a dance class or three classes in a quarter.”</p><div class="quote_box" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 10px;">“I don’t think I did anything stupid,” says Ward Goolsby. “If you make sure you are working towards it every quarter, it’s not hard to do.”</div><p>SESP advisors support students who need or want to graduate early and will help students plan their classes early enough, so they aren’t caught in a situation in which they can’t finish early.<br />
 <br />
“We have students who come in with AP credits or do their practicum in the summer, so they are able to finish early,” says Susan Olsen, assistant dean of student affairs for SESP. “You can’t do everything [at Northwestern]. [Students] have to choose what opportunities they will participate in and sometimes this leads to them graduating early.”<br />
 <br />
However, some students do sacrifice courses in favor of finishing early. For Pope, this meant dropping a double major for major and a minor and studying abroad in the summer as opposed to during the school year.<br />
 <br />
Medill senior Ward Goolsby, who is graduating two quarters early, believes he didn’t miss out on any amazing classes, but he did have a plan from the get-go. “I don’t think I did anything stupid,” he says. “If you make sure you are working towards it every quarter, it’s not hard to do.”<br />
 <br /><center> * * * </center></p><p><strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps">For those eager to enter</span></strong> the real world, there are some requirements that must be fulfilled. “The faculty wants to make you have the experiences that pull together a real undergraduate degree,” says Carolyn Lindley, director of undergraduate financial aid. “So, it’s not that you have gotten all of your requirements done quickly.”<br />
 <br />
This principle caused the creation of the Undergraduate Residence Requirement.  If a student takes five classes for the purpose of graduating early, the university has a right to charge an acceleration fee of $3,174: students must pay for the extra class. Once a student submits a petition to graduate, a committee will determine if the candidate is indeed eligible to finish early and if an acceleration fee is required. It is encouraged by advisors in all schools that students look into this requirement ahead of time.<br />
 <br />
“We can’t help students get seats in classes,” Disch says. “That’s not part of the Journalism Residency plan. Everyone has a reason for needing to take JOUR 301 in a specific quarter, but I have to let CAESAR manage it.”</p><div class="quote_box">If a student takes five classes for the purpose of graduating early, the university has a right to charge an acceleration fee of $3,174.</div><p>After Reid Spitzer, a Weinberg junior graduating a year early, worked a 9-5 job for the Chicago Field Studies program, he found working much more preferable than taking classes. “I don’t enjoy the idea of learning and taking classes,” he says. “I feel like I’m being judged on criteria that’s conducive to learning, like how often you attend class or how well you do on an assignment.” But Spitzer said he probably would have stayed all four years if he didn’t plan to attend law school.<br />
 <br />
Felicia Spahr, a Weinberg junior, has dreamed of living in Los Angeles for quite some time now. The aspiring screenwriter or film director planned to transfer to a university in L.A. However, that didn’t pan out, so Spahr found a different option: graduate a year early. </p><p>Spahr said she fought her way into a lot of film classes her first and second year without knowing she was going to graduate early and it paid off. “I would love to save a year’s worth of money, and I want to be able to go out to Los Angeles and do my thing,” Spahr says. “I don’t really want to be in school. I want to start my life.”<br />
  <br />
While Goolsby plans to head back to Texas to begin his broadcast journalism career, he is sad his college time is coming to a close. “One of the things I always try and stick to is why am I going to miss something. It’s not because of the place,” Goolsby says. “I mean Evanston is great and NU is great, but it’s the people I’ve met.”</p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Hannah Fraser-Chanpong and Felicia Spahr have contributed to North by Northwestern in the past.</em></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
