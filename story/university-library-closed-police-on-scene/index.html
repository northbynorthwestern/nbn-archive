Dear Members of the Northwestern Community:</p><p>I am saddened to report that a 25 year-old male student in the School of Continuing Studies was found dead in the University Library on the Evanston campus shortly before 10 a.m. Sunday, May 30, 2010. The Evanston Police Department, with assistance from University Police, is investigating and awaiting information on the cause of death from the Cook County Medical Examinerâ€™s Office.</p><p>The preliminary investigation indicates that there is no threat or potential danger to other members of the Northwestern community.</p><p>The University is not releasing further details regarding the studentâ€™s identity at this time at the request of his family.</p><p>On behalf of Northwestern, I offer our deepest sympathy to our studentâ€™s family, friends and fellow students. The death of any one member of our community affects all of us.</p><p>The University Library will be closed on Sunday, May 30, 2010. Members of the Northwestern community may use the Science and Engineering Library, 2233 Tech Drive, today. The University Library will re-open on Monday, May 31, 2010.</p><p>Staff members from Counseling and Psychological Services are available for students who may wish to speak with a counselor. CAPS can be contacted at 1-2151 or 1-8100 after hours.</p><p>Again, we extend our deepest sympathy.</p><p>William Banis<br />
