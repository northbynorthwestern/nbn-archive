Michigan State, Northwestern and Minnesota all fell short against quality opponents, with only Iowa beating a BCS opponent this week. The rest of the Big Ten feasted on lesser opponents, and Purdue suffered a disappointing setback with a loss against Northern Illinois. With Big Ten play looming, the conference’s reputation keeps taking hits.</p><p><center><br /><a href="index.html#Michigan">Michigan v.

True freshman stars Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson combined for only 68 yards passing and two interceptions, completing less than 42 percent of their passes. Although neither quarterback could pass for a touchdown, Robinson ran for 60 yards and two touchdowns. Senior halfback Carlos Brown though, stole the show for the Wolverines. Brown ran for 187 yards and two touchdowns on only 13 carries, including a 90-yard scamper for a score. The team ran for 380 yards total, scoring six touchdowns along the way. Michigan has already matched its win total from last season, starting out by winning its first three games. It will open Big Ten play next week when it hosts Indiana.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Minnesota"></a>California 35, Minnesota 21</h2><p>Junior running back sensation Jahvid Best, one of the fastest and most exciting players in the country, solidified his spot as a Heisman candidate as California continued its strong start with a win over Minnesota. Best ran for 131 yards and a modern school-record five touchdowns. Only Duke Morrison has matched that feat, way back in 1921. The Golden Gophers continued a very apparent trend early this season and verified that senior wide receiver Eric Decker is the source of the entire offense. Decker caught eight passes for 119 yards and two touchdowns, the third time he has eclipsed the 100-yard mark this season. Decker, who is a prized baseball player for Minnesota as well, also threw for seven yards and a touchdown. The rushing attack faltered once again for Minnesota, averaging only 1.8 yards per carry for only 37 yards. After barely squeaking by Syracuse and Air Force, this loss reaffirms that Minnesota could be in trouble this season. Northwestern fans will see the Golden Gophers first-hand next Saturday when the ‘Cats host Minnesota.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Penn"></a>Penn State 31, Temple 6</h2><p>Penn State overcame flu problems earlier this week to beat Temple Saturday, improving to 3-0 on the season. Junior halfback Evan Royster led the way for the Nittany Lions, running for 134 yards and a touchdown. His teammates added 52 yards and another score on the ground, and senior quarterback Daryll Clark threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns. Penn State did not have any real flashy plays or performances but continued its solid performance against a lackluster schedule. The Nittany Lions will get their first test of the season next week against Iowa.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Wisconsin"></a>Wisconsin 44, Wofford 14</h2><p>Wisconsin powered through overmatched Wofford Saturday with a balanced attack, staying undefeated early in the season. Junior quarterback Scott Tolzien had a consistent and solid performance, completing 75 percent of his passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns. The rushing attack, though, stole the show. Freshman quarterback Curt Phillips led the team in rushing with 92 yards on just four carries, while sophomore John Clay added 70 yards of his own. Junior Zach Brown had 63 yards and two touchdowns, while freshman Erik Smith added 54 yards and a score of his own. The very balanced attack earned 258 total yards and three touchdowns on the day. However, questions remain for Wisconsin before its Big Ten opener next Saturday against Michigan State. The Badgers fumbled six times, losing three of them, and have had shaky wins over overmatched opponents.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Purdue"></a>Northern Illinois 28, Purdue 21</h2><p>Northern Illinois won its first game against a Big Ten school since 1988 when it beat Purdue Saturday. The Huskies combined for 280 yards on the ground, accounting for three scores and exposing the Boilermaker defense. The Purdue offense, which had pounded the Toledo and Oregon defenses, sputtered against Northern Illinois. Sophomore Ralph Bolden, a star in the first two games, only ran for 64 yards without a score. Senior quarterback Joey Elliott threw for 188 yards and ran for 68 yards and two touchdowns, continuing the trend of athletic Big Ten quarterbacks. The Boilermakers are now 1-2 on the season and will only play Big Ten schools and Notre Dame from now on.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Ohio"></a>Ohio State 38, Toledo 0</h2><p>Sophomore sensation quarterback Tyrelle Pryor bounced back after a poor performance last week, leading Ohio State to an easy victory over Toledo. Pryor threw for 262 yards and three touchdowns, and ran for another score and 110 yards. The Buckeye rushing attack combined for 247 yards and two touchdowns on the day, just one week after being completely shut down by the Southern California defense. Ohio State will have a chance to make a statement next week against Illinois.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="MichState"></a>Notre Dame 33, Michigan State 30</h2><p>Notre Dame became the next big-time school to edge out a Big Ten school Saturday when it squeaked by Michigan State. Junior quarterback Jimmy Clausen lived up to his massive potential, throwing for 300 yards and two touchdowns. Junior wide receiver Golden Tate was his main target, racking up 127 yards and a touchdown while sophomore tight end Kyle Rudolph added 95 yards of his own. Junior halfback Armando Allen rumbled for 115 yards and a touchdown, and added a passing touchdown as well. The Spartans quarterback controversy appears to be over, as sophomore Kirk Cousins threw the ball 35 times for 302 yards and a touchdown. The lack of a solid rushing attack, however, continued to hold the Spartans offense back. Michigan State has started the season a disappointing 1-2 as it enters Big Ten play.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Indiana"></a>Indiana 38, Akron 21</h2><p>Indiana finished its cupcake non-conference schedule off with a win against an overmatched Akron Zips squad. While no one player stood out, Indiana’s ground attack accounted for 180 yards and two touchdowns. Junior quarterback Ben Chappell threw for 163 yards and two touchdowns, helping the Hoosiers stay balanced and consistent. The Hoosier defense showed big-play potential as well, intercepting four passes for 136 yards. The special teams also played well, giving Indiana a complete performance. Senior cornerback Ray Fisher scored the first touchdown of the day with a 91-yard kickoff return. The Hoosiers will start to get tested when they play Michigan and Ohio State back-to-back in the next two weeks.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Iowa"></a>Iowa 27, Arizona 17</h2><p>Iowa was the lone bright spot for the Big Ten this week, beating a Pac-10 opponent fairly handily. Junior quarterback Ricky Stanzi threw for 205 yards, and freshman running back Adam Robinson ran for 101 yards and two touchdowns. Robinson could be the next Shonn Greene, and his improvement and development will be key to the Hawkeyes’ success over the next couple years. Fellow freshman halfback Brandon Wegher added 46 yards and a touchdown of his own, giving Iowa two solid freshman options to groom. The Hawkeye defense, though, was the main success story of the day. The Arizona quarterbacks combined for only 105 yards, and its rushing attack could not find the end zone, albeit it compiled 148 yards on the ground. Aside from a late touchdown pass, the only Wildcat touchdown of the day was an interception return for a touchdown. After a shaky start, the undefeated Hawkeyes look to upset Penn State for the second straight year next Saturday.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p><h2><a name="Northwestern"></a>Syracuse 37, Northwestern 34</h2><p>The ‘Cats couldn’t overcome their injury problems Saturday against the jumpstart Syracuse Orange. Northwestern was without running backs Stephen Simmons and Jeravin Matthews, cornerbacks Sherrick McManis and Justan Vaughn, wide receiver Sidney Stewart and linebacker Nate Williams, among others. Senior quarterback Greg Paulus took advantage for the Orange, torching the suddenly depleted secondary for 346 yards and two touchdowns. The Wildcat secondary, once believed to be one of the best in the Big Ten, needed redshirt freshman Demetrius Dugar to start at cornerback. Dugar, previously thought to only be a special teams player at best, was overmatched against the Syracuse wide receivers. Senior wide receiver Mike Williams had a startling performance, catching 11 balls for 209 yards and two scores. The Orange rushing attack also had success, gaining 125 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. </p><p>Northwestern had its fair share of success on offense as well. Senior quarterback Mike Kafka threw for 390 yards and three touchdowns, ran for another score and caught a pass from senior wide receiver Andrew Brewer for a 22-yard touchdown. Brewer, who played quarterback in high school, helped Kafka score three different ways. The ‘Cats rushing attack, though, had problems without its three best options. Northwestern only ran for 52 yards, including Kafka’s touchdown scamper. Although Kafka had a remarkable performance, it was his goal-line fumble and late interception that cost Northwestern the game. The Wildcats hope to bounce back next Saturday when they host Minnesota.<br /><a href="index.html#top">Back to top</a></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
