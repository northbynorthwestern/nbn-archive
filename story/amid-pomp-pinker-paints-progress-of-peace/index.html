Pinker pulled from&nbsp;his book&nbsp;<em><a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature">The Better Angels of Our Nature</a>,&nbsp;</em>which was named one of the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>'s Best Books of 2011.</p><p>Ryan Auditorium was comfortably full with an audience ranging from freshmen to local adults, and it was speckled with recognizable faces: President Schapiro and his wife, Mimi; Dean of Students Burgwell Howard; Slavic Professor Gary Saul Morson; and Dr. Doris Dirks,&nbsp;<a href="../new-expanded-lgbt-resource-center-to-offer-more-se/index.html">future director of the LGBT Resource Center</a>. Though Pinker is a&nbsp;professor of psychology at Harvard,&nbsp;the night resounded with Northwestern history and tradition, as both the student and faculty member who introduced him referred to Professor Baker Brownell&rsquo;s mid-20th century class Contemporary Thought, which the speaker series aims to emulate.</p><p><strong>Conjuring a class from the past</strong></p><p>University archivist Kevin Leonard was also in attendance. He had been sought by the event&rsquo;s organizers near the beginning of 2012 for a historical analogue to the series, and he said he immediately thought of Brownell&rsquo;s class.</p><p>Professor Baker Brownell was "a very gifted popularizer of ideas and, by reputation, a very good speaker," Leonard said. According to the library&rsquo;s <a href="http://www-legacy.library.northwestern.edu/archives/findingaids/baker_brownell.pdf">record of his papers</a>, he was a soldier and journalist as well as a philosopher&ndash;when he joined Northwestern&rsquo;s faculty in 1921, it was in a journalism teaching post&ndash;and he was accordingly concerned with "the general topic of the human community," said Leonard.</p><p>It was a concern that flowed from his worry over vanishing small town life and respect for an intellectual whole.</p><p>Concerned by the increasing fragmentation of disciplines and the in-depth research pursuits of academics, which he believed kept students from assembling knowledge into a unified whole, he "concocted" his Contemporary Thought course near 1930, Leonard said.</p><p>The course brought in both premiere Northwestern faculty and outside intellectuals weekly. Students enrolled in Contemporary Thought could expect a lecture from a figure like Carl Sandburg, W.E.B. Du Bois, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Jane Addams. It was, according to Leonard, "wildly popular" among students.</p><p>&ldquo;He was the it guy for his period,&rdquo; said Leonard. And Pinker, he thought, was in line with Brownell&rsquo;s aims.</p><p>&ldquo;Pinker himself is able to take very intellectual ideas and popularize them,&rdquo; Leonard said. &ldquo;If Brownell were still alive, he&rsquo;d be on board with this.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>From student interest, administrative support</strong></p><p>Students apparently feel similar to Brownell. According to Weinberg senior Jonathan Green, who introduced Pinker, the event flowed from a survey that the Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee (UBPC) conducted. Northwestern undergraduates, he said, felt the University lacked serious, unifying intellectual events.</p><p>Green chaired last year&rsquo;s UBPC, which proposed an intellectually-oriented speaker series to the administration last February. Administrators accepted that idea, and a panel of students, faculty and administrators examined possible speakers convened last spring to discuss possible speakers. The panel included <a href="http://www.slavic.northwestern.edu/faculty/morson.html">Professor Gary Saul Morson</a>, <a href="http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/current/people/faculty/blair/">Professor Neal Blair</a>, and Bienen School Dean Toni-Marie Montgomery.</p><p>In his introduction of Pinker, Green said Pinker&rsquo;s talk, like Brownell&rsquo;s class, would address the "responsibility of the educated and Northwestern&rsquo;s moral activity in a rapidly changing world."</p><p>Professor Dan McAdams, the chair of Northwestern&rsquo;s Psychology Department, introduced Pinker after Green. Pinker, he said, "was one of the better angels of our shared intellectual nature."</p><p><strong>"The most peaceful era" ever</strong></p><p>Pinker&rsquo;s delivered his talk in a precise baritone and entirely from behind the podium. He painted a broad story of human progress in almost exactly an hour.</p><p>"Believe it or not, and I know most people do not, violence has been in decline for long stretches of time," he said. "We may be living in the most peaceful era in our human existence."</p><p>Violence, he said, had been initially tamed by man&rsquo;s move from anarchy to political bodies, and it was further limited by the civilizing eras and ideas that followed that rise.</p><p>In the medieval era, he said, the eradication of tribes and consolidation of states reduced feuding local nobles and warlords; in the Renaissance, the proliferation of printing and rise of literacy increased general empathy; Enlightenment ideas led to the outlawing of routine torture and slavery; and the "Long Peace" which followed World War II ended almost all Great Powers Wars. The "Rights Revolutions," a more recent development, had limited violence as well, as it empowered animals, women, children and racial and sexual minorities, he said.</p><p>Ultimately, he said, this reduction of violence might not continue, but it did rehabilitate the virtues of modernity and the truth of the idea of progress.</p><p>Charts filled his presentation, and his statistic evidence ranged from broad overviews of all human massacres since 500 B.C. as tabulated by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/books/the-great-big-book-of-horrible-things-by-matthew-white.html">&ldquo;atrocitologist&rdquo; Matthew White</a> to more exact but limited government-maintained national crime data.</p><p>He accepted the hypotheses of philosophers who worked before good data was available&ndash;when considering the reasons violence had decreased, he weighed Thomas Hobbes&rsquo;s idea of the <em>Leviathan,</em> a strong-state-led social contract&ndash;but rejected their evidence.</p><p>When Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau discussed man in a state of nature, he said, they were &ldquo;talking out of their hat.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A "romanticized view of what I thought college would be"</strong></p><p>Pinker took questions after the event. Alice Mills, a retired M.D. from Wilmette, asked about urban violence and images of violence in the media. Pinker replied that he thought media violence "was largely a red herring."</p><p>Asked afterward if she enjoyed the talk, Mills replied initially in one word: "No." It was all statistics, she said, and not &ldquo;addressed to individual threats of violence in urban society.&rdquo;</p><p>But Pinker got an ovation from the crowd, and student organizers seemed afterward to appreciate the event.</p><p>&ldquo;I really like how he touched on so many academic disciplines: psychology and statistics and political science and history and religion,&rdquo; said Weinberg junior Ellie Graham, who served on the panel that helped choose Pinker.</p><p>ASG President Austin Young also served on the panel. He appreciated the graphs and statistics Pinker used to support his view, because they made Pinker&rsquo;s "ideological and moral" thesis "tangible."</p><p>He also appreciated its broad intellectual focus.</p><p>"This is the romanticized view of what I thought college would be," he said. "That&rsquo;s like too story-book&hellip;"</p><p>"&mdash;but it <em>is</em> story-book!," finished Graham.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
