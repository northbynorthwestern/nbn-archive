North by Northwestern caught up with Zack Snyder, the man who tackled the &#8220;unfilmable film,&#8221; for a conference call. The director, who also lists <em>300</em> and <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> on his résumé, talked about superhero stories, <em>Watchmen</em>&#8217;s ensemble cast, and his unflinching approach to filming brutality.</p><p><strong>What made you decide to take on such a difficult project?</strong></p><p>The biggest thing was that when they first called me, I was very aware of this motion picture and I just felt like there was no way that I could do it, that I’d be able to figure it out. But after reading the script that the studio had, I felt like if I didn’t do it they were going to do it without me and they were going to do it like a sequel-able PG-13 movie set during the war on terror instead of 1985, and Manhattan goes to Iraq instead of Vietnam and the bad-guy ending is sort of exactly like you would imagine in a superhero movie. That was something that I felt that I couldn’t let happen that way. The material is so dense and awesome that […] the problem is once you make that leap for the movie you’re pretty much in for a three-year freak-out. And also, I just love it, so that’s why I did it.</p><p><strong>With the success of <em>The Dark Knight</em> and with Heath Ledger winning the Oscar, do you think superhero movies have a chance at the Oscars?</strong></p><p>Look, it’s all about this culture accepting that this is our mythology, you know? I think that’s the biggest turn that our culture has to make. I think it’s pretty obvious that this is our mythology, but the intelligentsia kind of fights that a little bit. As a people, it’s difficult to accept that the way our stories are told is by comics. It’s a pretty bitter pill to swallow, and people will fight it kicking and screaming … I don’t think that there’s anything nonintellectual about superheroes; I think it is what you make of it, but I think that people perceive that the danger is that we’re dumbing ourselves down by making superheroes our high art. That’s the deception. I don’t believe that’s true &#8212; I believe that superheroes have the ability to be as intellectually stimulating as anything.</p><p><strong>In the novel, the fictional cast members were really kind of an &#8220;ensemble.&#8221; Your cast, too, is really kind of an ensemble cast of young actors. Were there any difficulties in bringing this cast to the screen?</strong></p><p>I think the most difficult character to realize is Dr. Manhattan, for a bunch of reasons, but I think in some ways for me he’s one of the most rewarding. I’m a big fan of the graphic novel, but when I read the graphic novel getting ready to make the film, I thought about Dr. Manhattan in the sense of a character that renders pure philosophy at every turn, in the sense of a character who is interesting to hear talk but emotionally exists outside of the scope of the rest of the characters. The thing that I thought was cool about what Billy [Crudup] did, the thing I discovered along the way…is that Dr. Manhattan is a super-emotional character. He’s a dark and sad god, and I think that that’s what really came across in Billy’s rendering of the character. There’s this deep sadness that I thought was really interesting. It reinvented Manhattan for me.</p><p><strong>Do you think that Billy’s detachment from Hollywood helped [the film retain focus]?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, I think that that’s the cool thing. All my actors are fantastic, but they don’t play the Hollywood game and I think it makes the movie more interesting because you don’t go into the movie and think “Oh, there’s Billy dressed as Dr. Manhattan.&#8221; They are their characters, and I think that that’s what makes it really interesting.</p><p><strong>When does your adaptation stop being about just shooting a comic book and transform into its own movie?</strong></p><p>Well to me one of the most obvious things that a movie does that a comic book cannot do is…for instance, Manhattan [in the end of the movie], when I read it in the graphic novel, [he] was so overwhelmed with philosophy that it didn’t strike me as emotional. And for me it&#8217;s an emotional scene, so when I see that go down [on film] I think, wow, that’s emotional &#8212; these characters coming to this conclusion. It’s a supplemental experience to the graphic novel; it doesn’t replace them but merely enhances the experience.</p><p><strong>What, in such a faithful adaptation, makes this a “Zack Snyder movie&#8221;?</strong></p><p>I don’t know, I think the whole story itself, once it moves through the prism of the filmmaker…like the way I work, I sit and call the shots, and they exist in a slightly different format. For instance, Dave drew his drawings as vertical, and the movie will be mostly horizontal, so we have to recompose everything. It’s a pretty big deal. Just going back to that process alone, realigning the shots … that right there is like your hand is now on it, and the whole movie is going through you and coming back out. That process for me is really personal.</p><p><strong><em>Watchmen</em> was called the “unfilmable film,” and your first draft was three hours long. So with all you’ve had to go through, what [helped you persevere]?</strong></p><p>My main thrust was to keep it from becoming a superhero movie. Because in the studio’s mind, that’s a safe and cool idea, to make it as formulaic a superhero movie as you can. And I really felt like if that happened, there’d be nothing left of the original source material. So for me, anyway, it was pretty important to not let that happen.</p><p><strong>How did you deal with the <em>Black Freighter</em> [the comic book "inside" the comic book]?</strong></p><p>Because of the fans, my idea was to decide how I was going to get that in the movie. It’s not intuitive to get any of that stuff in. And what I ended up with was basically taking as much as I could from either <em>Under the Hood</em> or any of the supplemental texts and working them conceptually into the body of the film. And what we created was an animated version of that comic strip, and for blu-ray and DVD we’ve combined them into a single motion picture. So there’s a three-hour and 30-minute version of the movie with the <em>Black Freighter</em> cut in.</p><p><strong>How do you think a fan of <em>300</em> will react to the kind of violence in the film?</strong></p><p>Part of the reason why the violence in the movie is so extreme is that, for me, I wanted the idea of a superhero movie to be broken down at every level. As viewers, we are all used to this PG-13, homogenized violence that’s been put in a clean wrapper. The idea with the violence in <em>Watchmen</em> was to smash that concept as hard as I could &#8212; the idea that violence has no consequences, and that when they run into conflict there’s no danger. In <em>300</em> I think we kind of created an operatic version of violence… so I’m not sure how people will react to it, but that’s my intention.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
