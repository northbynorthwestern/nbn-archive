The apparent suicide occurred just a few days after footage of Clementi’s intimate encounter with another man was broadcast on the Internet.</p><p>Across the country, Clementi’s story started a dialogue about the treatment of LGBT individuals. Students created Facebook groups in his honor, columnist Dan Savage launched the &#8220;It Gets Better Project&#8221; on YouTube to offer support for LGBT individuals and New Jersey officials like Gov. Chris Christie made statements about the “unspeakable tragedy” caused by the students who filmed the encounter.</p><p>The university responded in an email from President Morton Schapiro and William Banis, vice president for student affairs. The message highlighted Northwestern’s policies of acceptance and tolerance, and asked the community to offer support in “preventing similar incidents.”</p><p>Despite the call to action in the last lines of the email, though, Northwestern’s policies towards cyberbullying remained unchanged following the incident. Currently, Northwestern policies do not explicitly address cyberbullying. However, recent tragedies on campuses like Rutgers suggest that a policy to protect individuals from online harassment might be necessary.</p><p>In May, the Campus Coalition on Sexual Violence convened to assess violation policies and to determine where the needs are in campus programming. The evaluation uncovered shortcomings in policies pertaining to cyberbullying, according to Laura Anne Stuart, sexual education and violence prevention coordinator and advisor of Sexual Health and Assault Peer Educators. “It has come out in those discussions that our campus policy doesn’t directly address stalking using media,” Stuart says.</p><div class="quote_box">Currently, Northwestern policies do not explicitly address cyberbullying. However, recent tragedies on campuses like Rutgers suggest that a policy to protect individuals from online harassment might be necessary.</div><p>Where online forums on collegeacb.com and Facebook exist, a risk of cyberbullying exists, too. While there is currently no policy in place to explicitly address cyberbullying, individuals like Stuart see the need for a specific policy at Northwestern and are working to bring attention to it.</p><p>It is difficult for the university to address commentators on sites like collegeacb because of anonymity options, but Northwestern does have the ability to address cyberbullying, even if the current policies do not. </p><p><center>* * *</center></p><p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>Weinberg senior Caroline Perry cannot think of an instance</span></strong> when she was cyberbullied at Northwestern. As the student outreach and guidance and peer solutions chair of the Rainbow Alliance and a member of the Gender Protection Initiative, the group that pushed for gender neutral housing, she describes Northwestern as a “a good place to be gay.”</p><p>On campus, this might be true. Northwestern does have physical spaces for LGBT students to find support: the third floor of Norris in the LGBT Resource Center, the CAPS offices located in the Searle building and, most recently, floors of 1835 Hinman and Kemper which were established as gender-neutral spaces.</p><p>But on collegeacb, the word “gay” is thrown out as an insult for specific individuals on campus. A search of the word brings up threads in which students are described as “gay ass mother fuckers” or “gay porn stars.” Multiple threads even compare the “gayness” of fraternities on campus.</p><p>For Communication junior Derrick Clifton, Northwestern&#8217;s online community does not seem to mirror the one that exists in everyday life when it comes to treatment of the LGBT community. Clifton is a member of the Rainbow Alliance and is involved with the LGBT Resource Center. Like Perry, Clifton has not experienced any cyberbullying during his time at Northwestern. He describes the community on campus as a “moderately accepting” one.</p><p>Despite his lack of personal experience, though, Clifton thinks there are some students who are closed-minded online. He attributes online harassment to a sense of empowerment that comes with the option of anonymity. “People feel they have agency to spew out lewd, obnoxious, negative, outlandish opinions about people on this campus that are in some ways both derogatory, defamatory and very disrespectful,” he says.</p><p>For some LGBT students, using Facebook as a means of defining sexual orientation can be problematic. Putting a gender in the “interested in” section can lead to unwanted harassment. For both personal and professional reasons, Clifton protects himself online. He keeps private settings on his Twitter account and makes an effort to avoid situations where homophobic people online might target him.</p><p>Doris Dirks is the coordinator of student organizations for social justice and the LGBT Resource Center.  She acknowledges that no campus is perfect in its treatment of the LGBT community, but, Northwestern is generally “pretty good,” she says.</p><div class="quote_box" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 10px">“People feel they have agency to spew out lewd, obnoxious, negative, outlandish opinions about people on this campus that are in some ways both derogatory, defamatory and very disrespectful,” Clifton says.</div><p>The Internet has provided some positive tools for the LGBT community. Dirks would like to create an online forum for students to find support, particularly individuals who are uncomfortable coming into the office.</p><p>However, the Internet has also introduced some negative behaviors towards the LGBT community. Dirks has dealt with students who request a new roommate after learning that the one assigned to them is gay through Facebook. Situations like this one in which social media breeds bullying and prejudice should not be tolerated, according to Dirks. “There should be a zero tolerance policy towards that because it is just as pernicious as face to face bullying,” Dirks says. “As a campus, we have community standards where that’s not acceptable.”</p><p><center>* * *</center></p><p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;"><strong>Northwestern’s policies do not explicitly address cyberbullying.</strong></span> Instead, if an incident of harassment or stalking occurs, it is addressed using policies that most resemble the situation, according to Jim Neumeister, assistant dean of students and director of student conduct and conflict resolution.</p><p>The sexual harassment policy is one way the university can address cyberbullying. Another option is the recently introduced Information Technologies policy, which monitors the misuse of university electronic resources. Finally, the first rule of the student code of conduct in the student handbook, which prohibits “physical abuse of any person or any action that threatens or endangers the emotional well being, health, or safety of any person,” can be applied, according to Neumeister.</p><p>Implementing a new policy to address cyberbullying presents challenges though, because it involves striking a balance between maintaining clear expectations for student behavior without introducing too many regulations, according to Neumeister. “It’s hard for us to pass a policy for every tiny little thing. But, I think in this case, however, there is enough concern specifically around cyberbullying,” he says.</p><p>As of right now, there are no specific plans to change policies on cyberbullying and harassment, but administrators like Neumeister and Stuart are working to make cyberbullying a more prominent issue on campus. Simply starting a conversation may be the first step in the process.</p><p>“Whether it’s toward the LGBT community, and certainly that is a vulnerable group, but towards any groups of students, we may want to have specific policies on [cyberbullying] because that in and of itself speaks widely to what the university thinks, and we don’t want to tolerate it,” Neumeister says.</p><p>Despite the lack of explicit cyberbullying policies, Neumeister says Northwestern&#8217;s current policies could handle a situation like the one involving Tyler Clementi at Rutgers. “We could address it and we could address it in an appropriate way, and I’m actually very confident about that,” Neumeister says.</p><p>In the event that a similar bullying situation occurred at Northwestern, the students responsible for streaming the video could be addressed through various university policies.</p><p>The policies in place are adequate, according to Neumeister, but students like Perry argue the administration should take a proactive stance when it comes to supporting the LGBT community. “Any campus at which there are incidents, not necessarily of the scale of Tyler Clementi, but incidents of cyberbullying, should signal to the university that there’s a problem,” Perry says.</p><p>Though cyberbullying policies might not be an urgent concern given the policies currently in place, instating a more specific policy could be a way to reaffirm Northwestern’s values of acceptance and diversity. Cyberbullying should be addressed for the welfare of all students, not just the LGBT community, according to Perry.</p><p>“I would just encourage [the administration] to really create a culture where we know we have a first amendment right, but we know to use it for what it was intended for,” Clifton says. “To share intellectual ideas, to have constructive dialogue, but not be bigoted or demean other people.“</p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: Spelling of &#8220;lewd&#8221; corrected.
