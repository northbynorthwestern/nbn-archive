Let’s go on a journey through the cities hosting games in the opening round.  Load up the van, grab plenty of munchies, and get ready for baseball overload.</p><p><strong>Chicago Cubs</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Chicago, Illinois<br /><strong>Proximity to NU:</strong> 8 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Wrigley Field<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 1908 (last World Series title)</p><p>Cubs fans are the most tortured souls in all of sports.  After management spent an <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/hotstove06/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&amp;id=2752428">exuberant amount of money</a> in the off season, the city of Chicago may finally have a winner in these Cubbies.  After an abysmal 66-96 record in 2006, the Cubs hired new manager Lou Piniella.  A former Yankee outfielder and championship-winning manager, his fiery leadership helped the Cubs earn a record of 85-77, turning these lovable losers into wonderful winners.  </p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=407296">Carlos Zambrano</a>, SP 18-13, 3.95 ERA	</p><p>Zambrano’s year was filled with more excitement than any player in the league.  He got off to a slow start, going 5-5 with a 5.62 ERA early on.  During his 11th start, Zambrano fought in the dugout with teammate and catcher Michael Barrett, who was exiled to San Diego shortly afterward.  Since that infamous game, Zambrano has recovered to record a career-high in wins (18) while also signing a lucrative contract extension with the Cubs.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> While they’ve finished with a <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/standings/index.jsp">win total in the mid-80s</a>, worst among those in the playoffs, don’t give up on this team.  The 2006 World Series champions, the St. Louis Cardinals, only had 83 wins.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Indians</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Cleveland, Ohio<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 364 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Jacobs Field<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 1997 World Series (Game 7 loss to Florida)</p><p>While the defending AL champions the Detroit Tigers took a little cat nap this summer, the Indians snapped up a playoff spot in a convincing manner.  No real superstars fill the roster, but that doesn’t detract from the all-around skill these players possess.  Players like Fausto Carmona (19-8 with a 3.06 ERA) had breakout seasons.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=282332">C.C. Sabathia</a>, SP  19-7, 3.21 ERA</p><p>Stuck on a mediocre team for most of his career, Sabathia will finally see exposure on the national stage.  If he has a huge postseason, he’s the most likely Cleveland player to become a household name.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> While they would likely dominate the NL, the Indians are stuck in the AL where other teams have much more intimidating lineups.  They might be able to get past the Yankees’ pitching in the opening round, but they’ll have to play an amazing game to make it to the World Series.</p><p><strong>Boston Red Sox</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Boston, Massachusetts<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 1003 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Fenway Park<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 2004 (World Series Champions)</p><p>After missing out on the 2006 playoffs, the Red Sox are back.  Carrying a roster full of all-stars, this team is primed for a long run into October.  They <a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070928&amp;content_id=2236937&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos">took away the AL East </a>crown from the Yankees after 12 years, something they couldn’t do in 2004.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=120074">David Ortiz</a>, DH  .332 AVG, 35 HR, 117 RBI</p><p>“Big Papi” is the face of the franchise and his <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=A9ZUK4Ci3cM">clutch performances</a> of the past have been some of the most revered in any sport.  He had a slight power drought this year, so the Red Sox will need a strong showing from him if they want to hoist another trophy in downtown Boston.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> They have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs and will be a favorite to win it all.  If they play their game, it will take an outstanding effort from opponents to overcome the Sox.</p><p><strong>New York Yankees</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Bronx, New York<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 816 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Yankee Stadium<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 26 World Series championships</p><p>Even after their atrocious start this season, it was unlikely that the Yankees would miss out on the playoffs. The Bronx Bombers are making their 13th straight playoff appearance; however, this time they’re not holders of the AL East title.  They had a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19643333/">rough first half of the season</a>, but they’ve stepped it up in the second half, finishing with a record of 94-68.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=121347">Alex Rodriguez</a>, 3B .314 AVG, 54 HR, 156 RBI</p><p>Ladies and gentleman, your 2007 AL MVP.  But his monster season doesn’t matter now to Yankee fans.  It’ll be these next few weeks that determine if they want him back.  A-Rod has had some notoriously pitiful playoff performances, hitting .158 with no home runs or RBI’s the past two postseasons.  In both of the past two years, the Yankees have exited in the opening round.  Mr. Steinbrenner wants his money to bring him world championships, not participation ribbons.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> The Yankees haven’t won a championship since 2000, which is like a lifetime for this storied franchise.  Unfortunately, they’ll have more disappointment this year as their pitching is unlikely to hold up against opposing offenses.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Phillies</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 785 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Citizens Bank Park<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 1980 (only World Series title)</p><p>This team is great example of just how unpredictable baseball can be.  The Phillies were virtually left for dead seven games out of the division on September 12th.  And now they’re NL East champions, jockeying for their first World Series title in 27 years.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=400284">Chase Utley</a>, 2B .332 AVG, 22 HR, 103 RBI</p><p>Utley had an eventful 2007. He signed a large contract extension and missed a month because of a broken right hand, but he still had impressive numbers.  He may not be the superstar of the team, but he’s the spark plug that’s essential for the Phillies.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> While they possess a formidable offense, their pitching will need to step up.  Great pitching will always beat good hitting.</p><p><strong>Arizona Diamondbacks</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Phoenix, Arizona<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 1796 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Chase Field<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 2001 (World Series title)</p><p>Youth has invaded this clubhouse, but the veterans don’t seem to mind.  They’re not quite the 2001 champions, but younger players like Chris Young, Connor Jackson, and Justin Upton provide raw talent.  Veterans like Livan Hernandez and Orlando Hudson supply skill that can be gained only through experience.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=407878"> Jose Valverde,</a> RP 47 SV, 2.66 ERA</p><p>The Diamondbacks closer not only pitches well, but also puts on a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=KVzeyyeppWk&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">great show</a>. While some players may get distracted by their emotions, Valverde uses it to his advantage.  His excitement electrifies his team and the entire stadium, though some may see it as “showing up the other team.”  If you see Valverde in the game, it’s good news for the D-Backs.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong>  This team has a lot of potential, and they’ll do a lot of growing up this postseason.  It’s up to the veteran players to take the lead.</p><p><strong>Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Anaheim, California<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 2023 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Angel Stadium of Anaheim<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 2002 (first World Series title)</p><p>It’s hardly a miracle that the Angels are playing fall baseball.  More powerful than the 2002 championship team, they were many people&#8217;s preseason favorite to win the AL West and didn’t disappoint.  This team is loaded with offensive juggernauts, including Home Run Derby champion Vladimir Guerrero.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch:</strong><a href="http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=407793">John Lackey</a>, SP 19-9, 3.01 ERA</p><p>Again, great pitching trumps good hitting, and if Lackey can continue his amazing 2007 season, he might have another ring on his hand.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> Every part of the Angels’ team must be at its best to clear the competition.  If one part fails, the Angels will likely go with it.</p><p><strong>Colorado Rockies</strong></p><p><strong>Home:</strong> Denver, Colorado<br /><strong>Distance from NU:</strong> 1013 miles<br /><strong>Stadium:</strong> Coors Field<br /><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> 1995 (only playoff appearance)</p><p>After an awe-inspiring <a href="http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20071001&amp;content_id=2244506&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col">13-inning win</a>  against the Padres Monday, the Rockies clinched their second ever playoff appearance by winning the NL Wild Card. Todd Helton had his usual high-production season, but was finally backed up by great young players such as Matt Holliday and <a href="http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071002&amp;content_id=2246379&amp;vkey=news_col&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col">Troy Tulowitzki</a>.  Plus, they have a great pitching staff and no starting pitcher with an ERA above five.</p><p><strong>Player to Watch: </strong><a href="http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=433585">Jeff Francis</a>, SP 17-9, 4.22 ERA</p><p>Francis quietly had a career season and cemented his place as the ace on the staff.  He has a big chance to become a star player, but maybe it’d be best if he stayed unknown, especially while facing opposing batters.</p><p><strong>Final Prognosis:</strong> Just playing this time of year is a huge step in the right direction for the franchise.  If they don’t make it deep into the playoffs this year, they’ll stay in the playoff picture for at least the next few.</p><p><strong>Predicted World Series: Arizona vs. Boston</strong><br />
Boston is a pretty easy pick here, as they have the best record of any team and are the most formidable, but Arizona will surprise those who haven’t seen them play.</p><p><strong>Winner: Boston Red Sox</strong></p><p>Bostonians won’t have to wait another 86 years for their next title.  The World Series trophy will once again find residence at 4 Yawkey Way.  Alright, now it’s time to go watch some games.  If you have a chance, go down to Wrigleyville while the Cubs are playing at home. This may be your only chance to experience October baseball firsthand while at Northwestern.</p><p><em>All stats courtesy MLB.com as of Wednesday, videos courtesy YouTube, LCC</em></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
