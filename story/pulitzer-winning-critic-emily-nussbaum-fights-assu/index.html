Not Emily Nussbaum.</p><p>Nussbaum is <i>The New Yorker</i>&rsquo;s television critic, and she rejects nearly all of these. It&rsquo;s something she honed as an editor at <i>New York&nbsp;</i>magazine, where, after writing and editing so many, she eventually turned against top-10 lists and created the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/approvalmatrix/12084/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496378672880000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENN684MoBWxZcDFufzdid7lsE0qQ" target="_blank">Approval Matrix</a>, a &ldquo;deliberately oversimplified guide&rdquo; to the week in culture. It&rsquo;s also led her to the 2016 Pulitzer for criticism, and it&rsquo;s influenced what she called her &ldquo;underlying argument about television&rdquo;: Television is an art form in its own, and doesn&rsquo;t need to be simplified by ratings or hierarchies.</p><div class="sidebar"><p><i>NBN spoke to Emily Nussbaum before her talk. Here are the edited and condensed highlights of what she had to say.</i></p><p>&ldquo;My advice is not to listen to the advice of people my age about journalism. Journalism has changed so radically, there&rsquo;s been this incredible breakdown in the industry. I feel always a little ill at ease giving advice to young people who want to become arts critics because nothing is really replicable about stuff that I did because the way that people are paid, the way that people are hired, a lot of the career paths in are not available in the same way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one thing I will say is &ndash; aside from obvious things, like read everything &ndash; if you ever have an opportunity to get a job at a journalistic startup with money, take it. Then you end up working with a small group of people where it&rsquo;s actually supported by something, that you can do every job. A lot of the jobs that I had early on amounted to small magazines where I was working with really cool people. You learn a lot from jobs like that, rather than taking a small job at an enormous place where you&rsquo;re not going to get to do as much.&rdquo;</p><p>The other thing is that you should respect and develop a good relationship with editors, especially great editors, starting out, because inevitably they will get promoted and get different jobs, and you will already be their writer. I was lucky and had great editors who then went from small places to big places. And when they went, they wanted me to write for them, which helped me massively.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Luckily, because TV has technologically changed, a lot of stuff is available whether it&rsquo;s on the air now or not. I&rsquo;m crazy about The Leftovers. It&rsquo;s an amazing show, it&rsquo;s very strange. It&rsquo;s not going to be to everyone&rsquo;s tastes, but I&rsquo;m finding it just thrilling, really great. I loved this year, Fleabag, which is a British dark sexual comedy by this amazing woman, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. And I loved Search Party, which is this strange little show on TBS. I loved Atlanta, which is Donald Glover&rsquo;s great show. And then Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which I&rsquo;m just obsessed with and recommend to everybody.&rdquo;</p></div><p>Nussbaum proved that Thursday night at the Contemporary Thought Speaker Series&rsquo; last event of the year: her talk, moderated by Nick Davis, an associate professor in the English Department and Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies Program who teaches a course on film criticism. But not before Davis got off to a good start with Nussbaum, gushing about her review of <i>The Leftovers</i> inspired the writers of the show, one of whom he knows personally.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to make you cry,&rdquo; Davis joked. &ldquo;I feel like that&rsquo;s my job as an interviewer.&rdquo;</p><p>Davis started off asking Nussbaum about her unorthodox start in arts criticism &ndash; how she in fact studied English and creative writing, dropped out of graduate school, and worked as a social worker for a bit before finding her way to TV criticism.</p><p>&ldquo;It just seems so mean,&rdquo; Nussbaum said of her initial perceptions of criticism. &ldquo;It seems like a parasitical activity.&rdquo; She later found, though, that it played to her &ldquo;being witty sometimes&rdquo; and &ldquo;kind of enthusiastic quality.&rdquo;</p><p>Nussbaum also used her own experiences to offer some advice to budding critics. For one, don&rsquo;t just consume the type of media you want to write about. Nussbaum said her poetry background, having written poetry reviews for <i>The New York Times</i>, sometimes finds its way into her TV criticism &ndash; such as her <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/the-new-normal&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496378672881000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsJR0s3RbjR24tqK1AjB59XUolFA" target="_blank">review</a> of <i>The Normal Heart</i>, where she draws on Thom Gunn&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Man with the Night Sweats.&rdquo; This, she said, makes essays &ldquo;feel thicker,&rdquo; as opposed to just being about TV.</p><p>Nussbaum has written for two of New York City&rsquo;s most prominent culture magazines, sometimes seen as polar opposites: <i>New York</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>. While some may worry about having to live up to a &ldquo;stuffy&rdquo; voice and style at a magazine like <i>The New Yorker</i>, Nussbaum said she only made a few changes to her writing.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing my stuff in <i>The New Yorker</i> for the first time was a shock,&rdquo; Nussbaum said, recounting how she had read the same font when she was younger. &ldquo;The main thing was, I felt like I had to earn my jokes a little more.&rdquo;</p><p>Some may not know Nussbaum for her work in <i>The New Yorker</i>, though. Perhaps, instead, it&rsquo;s for her political opinions, which she tends to voice on Twitter between commentaries on shows. Nussbaum said after the election, she found it hard to justify criticism at first &ndash; going back to it being &ldquo;parasitic.&rdquo; But, she found inspiration to continue as a critic through the shows she was watching post-election, like <i>The Crown</i> and <i>Parks &amp; Recreation</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;I found I was so absorbed in certain shows, often which had nothing to do with what was going on,&rdquo; Nussbaum said. &ldquo;I always feel this weird gratefulness to the shows I was watching during that period.&rdquo;</p><p>Obviously, no conversation with someone who gets paid to watch and write about TV would be complete without discussing shows themselves either. Most of that took place during an audience Q&amp;A, when Nussbaum touched on series finales, changing her mind about shows halfway through a season or series and how reality TV is &ldquo;the television of television. (Basically, it&rsquo;s perceived as a low genre of something already perceived as a low medium.)</p><p>At one point during the Q&amp;A, Lauren Herold, a doctoral student in Screen Cultures, asked Nussbaum about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-does-the-male-gaze-mean-and-what-about-a-female-gaze-52486&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496379329300000&amp;usg=AFQjCNERUp62XnZF8UR3O8kz1H1a2anHzw" target="_blank">the male gaze and female gaze</a>, academic topics that sometimes seep into TV writing. When Nussbaum mentioned a panel she sat on with <i>Orange Is the New Black</i> creator Jenji Kohan and <i>Transparent</i> creator-director Jill Soloway, where they argued about gazes in TV, Herold said that panel inspired her to study TV at the doctoral level.</p><p>&ldquo;I often look to her when I am struggling to form an opinion about a show I&rsquo;m watching,&rdquo; Herold said. &ldquo;I went [to the panel] and I realized it was everything I wanted to talk about for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>And Nussbaum&rsquo;s answer about the male gaze and female gaze?</p><p>&ldquo;I bridle at these terms and find them frustrating,&rdquo; Nussbaum said, bringing up shows like <i>I Love Dick</i> and arguing that men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s preferences can&rsquo;t be simplified. &ldquo;Is there like a lesbian gaze?&rdquo;</p><p>The night ended with students telling Nussbaum about the shows they&rsquo;re watching, like <em>Twin Peaks</em> and <em>Master of None</em>, and Nussbaum lamenting with students about the cancellation of shows like <i>Sense8</i> and <i>The Get Down</i>. An anecdote from much earlier in the talk, however, better encapsulated the night&rsquo;s big idea. Davis brought up the specific piece that got him hooked on Nussbaum: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1496378672882000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdbonJrx21MFk746FrASflzVggzg" target="_blank">Difficult Women</a>,&rdquo; a reminiscence on <i>Sex and the City</i> and its flaws a whole 15 years after the show ended, which epitomizes Nussbaum&rsquo;s work. Davis said it made him want to read everything Nussbaum ever wrote. Nussbaum related it back to what she stands for.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like some of my pieces. I love that piece,&rdquo; Nussbaum said. &ldquo;That piece is just a trojan horse for my underlying argument about television.&rdquo;</p><p>Nussbaum best summed up this argument &ndash; for a sort of &ldquo;contemporary thought,&rdquo; in TV &ndash; in an interview before the talk: &ldquo;Developing a language of talking about television as television, instead of talking about it in comparison to movies, in comparison to books,&rdquo; and &ldquo;breaking down what I feel like is the false hierarchy that people have about TV shows.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Editor's Note: This story was updated to accurately reflect Nussbaum's experience working with top-10 lists at</em>&nbsp;New York.&nbsp;<em>North by Northwestern regrets the error.</em></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
