This isn’t Saturday morning cartoons. And swim trunks are NEVER shorts, boys. Ever. We can tell. Photo by Katie Tang/North by Northwestern</div><p></center></p><p>You’re hip. You’re cultured. You’re artsy. Your idea of a fun Friday night is a casual dinner with friends and a play, maybe some Red Mango afterwards or a little coffee to discuss the show. I know your style. But do you know how to style yourself?</p><p>Say you&#8217;re going to a show tonight. What are you going to wear? It might seem like a shallow or obvious question, but really: Do you wear sweatpants? Do you do your hair? Do you wear jewelry? If it isn’t as cold, do you go sleeveless? Are jeans and a T-shirt appropriate? Must you pull out the high heels? The possibilities are endless. </p><p>At Northwestern, students have the opportunity to truly immerse themselves in theater, both on campus and off. The Northwestern student theater scene is one of the most active in the nation, and students are just an El ride away from professional theater downtown. Sure, it&#8217;s important to dress appropriately for live theater, but with so many options, how do you determine what&#8217;s appropriate? </p><p>Tom Casserly, a Communication freshman, says it really depends on how much you paid for the ticket. A <a href="http://www.steppenwolf.org/">Steppenwolf</a> ticket is usually expensive (even though they have discounted rates for students) and the prices get higher with other theaters like <a href="http://www.chicagoshakes.com/">Chicago Shakespeare Theater</a>, <a href="http://www.victorygardens.org/content/">Victory Gardens</a> and <a href="http://www.goodmantheatre.org/">Goodman</a>. So does that mean you always have to hunt for the ballet flats and gold bangles or jacket and tie every time you see the theater?  </p><p>It&#8217;s true that how one dresses for the theater is changing. Gone are the days of getting dolled up and wearing your mink, giant pearls and diamonds and full-length gown. There is no more need for coattails and tuxedos with slicked-back hair. &#8220;The level of formal dress in the theater has definitely [changed],&#8221; said Communication sophomore Carly Robinson while gesturing downward, illustrating the trend in appropriate dress. No one wants to be caught dead at Steppenwolf or Chicago Shakespeare wearing cut-off jeans and a neon American Apparel shirt. And there are actually practical considerations for theater dress rules; they aren&#8217;t just archaic traditions. For instance, your neon tee would be a big distraction to the actor, blinding him with hot orange (besides, neon is <em>so</em> 2007). Just because American Apparel may be out, however, doesn&#8217;t mean you should wear six-inch heels and a homecoming dress. Comfort is vital, especially when attending theater in a walking city like Chicago. The key is to strike a balance between comfort and chic and to not wear anything too overstated. A theatrical event in the city is not the time to make a statement about how edgy or unique you are.</p><p>For girls, pull out the skirts and dresses and don&#8217;t forget tights to avoid frostbite on the El. Would the Goodman kick you out for wearing jeans? Probably not. But it&#8217;s best to wear dark jeans and even better to wear dress pants. Also remember &#8212; the nicer you dress, the less conspicuous you appear among all those old people who think you can&#8217;t hear them whispering about you. Another way to avoid judgment from the <a href="http://wordsmith.org/awad/awadmail53.html">&#8220;blue hairs,&#8221;</a> as the older subscribers are sometimes called, is to avoid showing skin. Shoulders are for the mall or the club, not for the theater. That isn&#8217;t to say that a sleeveless cocktail dress is unacceptable, but a cardigan or blazer will save you both from the typical chilliness of arctic theater lobbies and the unabashed glares from the aforementioned blue hairs. For tops, you probably shouldn&#8217;t wear a t-shirt, but rather choose a blouse, sweater or dressier evening top. Jewels are fun, but unnecessary if you are an <em>au natural </em>kind of gal. Honestly, the rule of thumb is to dress a little nicer than you think you might have to. Dressing nice for the theater is a polite compliment to the performers and the establishment, and doing so costs you nearly nothing. Plus you bought the ticket for a night out &#8212; why not dress up to the ticket price?</p><div style="width:450px;float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><img src="../../media/uploads/2009/02/picture-128.jpg"><div class="caption"> Blazers and collared shirts are always a nice way to show your respect at a theatrical event, boys. Plus, don’t you just feel hip? Jewelry and nicer dark blouses are nice for girls, and skirts are ok (if the weather permits) as long as the skirt is long enough&#8230;/Photo by Katie Tang/North by Northwestern.</div></div><p>Guys, I know how some people can talk about clothes for hours, and I know that those people are probably not of your gender, so here&#8217;s the short version. Khakis are good, dress pants are good, collared shirts are good, ties are unnecessary but good, and make sure your belt matches your shoes for the love of theater. Although it&#8217;s in fashion this year to mismatch your belt and your shoes, for those of us who aren&#8217;t so &#8220;edgy,&#8221; just put black with black and brown with brown. Once again, dark jeans are probably okay, but it&#8217;s always nice to dress up, not down, unless you are in fierce opposition to dress pants.</p><p>Big no&#8217;s: hats (trust me, I&#8217;ve done this), sweatpants, tennis shoes, chest hair, belly buttons, visible boxers, muscle shirts, flip-flops and, of course, neon.</p><p>How are the rules different for on-campus theater? It largely depends on where you are going and who the participants are. &#8220;If it&#8217;s student theater, it&#8217;s more casual and you can wear whatever you want,&#8221; said Robinson. &#8220;But if it&#8217;s a theater in the city, you should probably dress nicer.&#8221; When it comes to student-produced shows, pretty much anything goes. As Communication sophomore Evan Troost puts it, &#8220;You could probably come in a swimsuit if you wanted.&#8221;</p><p>While this might be a slight exaggeration, theater on campus <em>is</em> more casual for several reasons. &#8220;It is a group of peers,&#8221; said Troost. &#8220;Also, there are so many that go up every week that if it was this high-and-mighty event, then we wouldn&#8217;t go nearly as often.&#8221; It&#8217;s hard to compare on-campus shows with the professional theater one might see in Chicago. For the students involved in campus productions, the shows are more about improving as performers, directors and producers, than they are about creating a perfect professional production. At places out in the &#8220;real world&#8221; of theater, like Goodman, there are more expectations in terms of how to dress and be a good audience member. &#8220;No one will kick you out of the theater for wearing jeans as long as you look respectful, said Troost. &#8220;But don&#8217;t wear a swimsuit to a Goodman show.&#8221;  </p><p>So advisable clothing? Wear what you wore to school. I&#8217;ve worn sweatpants &#8212; it&#8217;s ok. I prefer to wear something a little nicer though. Why? I guess for me it&#8217;s always been a respect thing. Especially when students use their free time to put in the hours it takes to put up a piece of theater. When they aren&#8217;t even being paid and when they are just trying to learn and share what they can do, I like to show them that I care about what they&#8217;re doing by showing that I took the time to dress well for the event.</p><p>If you&#8217;re truly passionate about seeing theater, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that theater is a community experience in a number of ways. &#8220;Theater is for a community,&#8221; said Casserly. &#8220;It is supposed to bring the audience together for interaction, and that&#8217;s why it matters more what you wear. It is about showing respect to the actors and the production. The audience is a part of the event of the show, and so we have a relationship with the people on-stage. I feel obligated to respect the actors.&#8221; </p><p>So whether it&#8217;s a student show on campus or a $30 ticket to <a href="http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/Production.aspx?prod=81"><em>Desire Under the Elms</em></a> downtown, remember that you may be watching the actors, but the actors are also watching you. So be respectful and remember: Try not to blind them.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
