Photo by Emily Chow / North by Northwestern.</div></div><p><strong>Mike Kafka – Class of 2010 (QB):</strong> Selected in the fourth round of the NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, Kafka has managed to remain unscathed in the Philadelphia quarterback saga. Kafka, who finished his NU career with a school-record 532 passing yards in an electrifying Outback Bowl, has been listed as the third string quarterback on the Eagles’ depth chart for most of the season. As recently as Sunday, Kafka was listed as Philadelphia’s number two quarterback behind starter Kevin Kolb in place of an injured Michael Vick. If Kolb were to go down before Vick stops being forced to <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5696292">hide in the locker room</a> during his team&#8217;s games, the former Wildcat just might appear under center for the Eagles.</p><p><strong>Corey Wootton – Class of 2010 (DE):</strong> Perhaps the player with the most NFL potential from the 2010 graduating class, Wootton was selected as the 109<sup>th</sup> pick in the draft by the Chicago Bears. Wootton was an all Big-Ten Team Selection in 2008, but devastatingly tore his ACL in the 2008 Alamo Bowl. He never seemed to regain his 2008 form in his senior season, but the Bears took a chance on Wootton, signing him to a four-year contract over the summer. The New Jersey native has seen little playing time thus far, but could be a key cog on the Bears’ defensive line for years to come.</p><div style="width: 300px; float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-right: 10px;"><img src="../../media/uploads/2010/10/sherrick1.jpg"><div class="caption">Sherrick McManis in a game against Ohio State. Photo by North by Northwestern. </div></div><p><strong>Sherrick McManis – Class of 2010 (CB):</strong> The Wildcats’ 2009 defensive MVP was the Houston Texans’ fifth round draft pick. He competed for a roster spot in training camp, and is starting to get some playing time due to the Texans’ sub-par pass coverage. McManis recorded nine interceptions in his time at NU, and managed to pick off Eli Manning in Week 5 of the NFL season for his first career interception. He was listed as inactive with a hamstring injury for the Texans’ game on Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p><strong>Andrew Brewer – Class of 2010 (WR):</strong> Brewer had an outstanding senior season at NU, catching 57 passes for 925 yards and nine touchdowns. The quarterback turned wide receiver was unsurprisingly not drafted, but was invited to the New England Patriots’ mini-camp over the summer. After nothing materialized with the Pats, Brewer signed as a receiver with the United Football League’s Omaha Nighthawks, just making the team’s roster before the start of their season. He serves on special teams and is an occasional target for long-time NFL quarterback Jeff Garcia, who has found himself yet another new home in Omaha.</p><p><strong>Tyrell Sutton – Class of 2009 (RB):</strong> Sutton was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent out of NU, but was then claimed on waivers by the Carolina Panthers. The former consensus Big Ten Freshman of the Year finished his NU career as the school’s second all-time leading rusher with 3,886 yards. He saw little playing time his NFL rookie year, appearing in seven games in which he rushed for 68 yards and recorded 62 receiving yards total. In early September, an NFC team reportedly asked about Sutton’s availability, but the Panthers dismissed the notion of moving him, content with their number three running back. Sutton has been inactive for five out of the Panthers’ seven games this season.</p><p><strong>Prince Kwateng – Class of 2009 (LB):</strong> After being passed over in the NFL draft, Kwateng signed with the UFL’s California Redwoods for the league’s inaugural season. He was a starting linebacker, and ranked third on the Redwoods’ defense with 30 tackles. After the UFL season was over, the Super Bowl champion-bound New Orleans Saints signed Kwateng onto their practice squad. The former NU standout wouldn’t be a part of an NFL organization for long, lasting only a week with the Saints. Kwateng has rejoined the UFL for a second season, but still hopes to get another opportunity with an NFL team.</p><p><strong>John Gill – Class of 2009 (DT): </strong> Gill was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Detroit Lions in April 2009 before ending up with Indianapolis Colts in the summer of 2009. In early August, Gill was arrested and charged with public intoxication in Indianapolis. Gill was reportedly found passed out on the side of a road at 4 a.m. during one of his off days from training camp. He appeared in two games as a rookie with the Colts last year, but will likely remain inactive for the rest of the season. Gill is no stranger to team discipline. In 2008, Pat Fitzgerald suspended Gill for NU’s season opener due to an undisclosed violation of team policy.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
