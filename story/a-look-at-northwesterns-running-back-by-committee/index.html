The main concern: The effectiveness of a green offense that featured very little experience at the skill positions, especially running back. Following a competitive spring and summer, which was pockmarked by crops of injuries and inconsistencies, no single player had stood out as a definite or surefire starter in the Wildcat&#8217;s spread offense. Instead, implementing a “running-back-by-committee” approach, which distributes the workload among a number of players, the Northwestern coaching staff await the continuing development of their tailback projects and a trial-by-fire for many of those who had not yet seen the field. North by Northwestern spoke with running backs coach Matt MacPherson and junior halfback Jacob Schmidt on the progress of the committee this far into the season.</p><p>The only one of the group with any game experience is veteran junior Stephen Simmons, a former third-stringer and a contributor in the past on special teams as a kick returner. Beyond Simmons, junior Jacob Schmidt, sophomores Scott Concannon and Jeravin Matthews and freshman Arby Fields have looked to earn their share of time.</p><p><strong>Stephen Simmons</strong></p><p>A lightweight who relies on his quickness and ability to slip through the smallest of gaps, Simmons&#8217; greatest assets are his in-game experience and familiarity with Northwestern&#8217;s offense. Unlike his predecessor, Tyrell Sutton, Simmons doesn&#8217;t have the weight to punch through for an extra yard after contact and can&#8217;t out run the secondary, but his lateral quickness makes him a headache beyond the line of scrimmage, evidenced by a 99-yard kickoff return and impressive touchdown runs against Michigan last year and Eastern Michigan this year. A nagging ankle injury has prevented him from seeing the field, but make no mistake: Simmons has the goods. </p><p>“Simmons is our most experienced and is the leader in the group, no question about it,&#8221; MacPherson said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look to him to be our go-to guy. We know what we&#8217;re getting from him.”</p><p><strong>Jacob Schmidt</strong></p><p>A walk-on role player who recently earned a scholarship, no one expected Schmidt to be in the mix, especially after sitting out spring ball with an injury. His lowered-shoulder tenacity and brute temerity have impressed coaches as a third-down back or on short-yardage situations. Fans will remember his blocked punt last year against Southern Illinois. His lack of top speed and quickness leaves his brunt force as his singular calling card, but it&#8217;s proven to be effective. With Simmons out in recent weeks, Schmidt has stepped up to be the starting tailback and has not disappointed with his consistent effort and results. </p><p>When asked about his sudden rise to the top of the depth chart, Schmidt said, “Spring ball was rough, because I was out with surgery, but we all knew that this was going to be a competitive job and that we were going to support each other. It&#8217;s been great to be able to play this much, but we all know that we have something unique and we have to be ready when our name is called.”</p><p>“He&#8217;s not going to beat you with his speed, but Jacob has heart and aggressiveness that we like to see and need in a back,&#8221; MacPherson said. </p><p><strong>Jeravin Matthews</strong></p><p>One of two true freshmen last year to see the field, Matthews made the transition from wide receiver to running back at the request of the coaching staff, and for what Schmidt cannot contribute, Matthews delivers to the plate. Boasting 4.3-speed and a lanky frame with deceptive tools to boot, Matthews contributes lightning speed in the backfield. Particularly useful for him are his receiver skills, as the five-wide sets in Northwestern&#8217;s spread offense depends on the tailback to be capable in this component of the offense. </p><p>“As a receiver, we liked Jeravin&#8217;s speed and quickness, and he&#8217;s only going to get better as a running back,” MacPherson said.</p><p>Time will tell whether this gamble will pay off, as Matthews has seen little tailback time this season, but plenty as a kick returner on special teams. </p><p><strong>Scott Concannon</strong></p><p>MacPherson&#8217;s one word that resonated about Concannon: “Hustle.” Another candidate for both kickoff duties and tailback responsibilities, Concannon showed some grit early in the season with successes against Towson and Eastern Michigan, but his workload has disappeared as of late. The game tape says that he&#8217;s not going to outrun many defenders, but his pacing and awareness make him a reliable option off the bench.</p><p><strong>Arby Fields</strong></p><p>The true freshman, one of three to see the field this year, has been a glimmer of hope and a head-scratcher of a wild card this season. Notably, his dehydration and consequent cramping early in the season and the need to improve his pass-blocking has left his workload sparser than some would have anticipated, but his potential is promising and his awareness can only improve as his familiarity in the offense and strength matures. </p><p>“Arby is only going to get better,&#8221; MacPherson said. &#8220;He&#8217;s still learning Big Ten football and still growing mentally and physically as he learns things and develops. He&#8217;s obviously very good, but the sky&#8217;s the limit for this kid.”</p><p><strong>What to expect</strong></p><p>Besides the obvious running aspect of the tailback position, there is a demand for these players to contribute more besides a good juke and a cloud of dust. The necessity to pass-block well was highlighted by Fields&#8217; backstep in productivity, as well as the ability to read the secondary in designed pass plays. The running back must be versatile, and indeed, there is no other player that must adapt to every level of defense and scheme on a regular basis.</p><p>With Northwestern on the southern end of the standings in rushing categories for the season, the need to improve has not been lost on the Wildcats. Each of the five options brings something unique to the plate, whether it be hustle, power, experience, speed or pure potential. Competition reigns supreme between the tackles and teammates, but for Northwestern to have a well-rounded offense, the ground game must improve and take the spotlight.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
