The program takes the &#8220;drama&#8221; of <em>The O.C.</em> and waters it down a bit (it does air on ABC Family, after all), all while featuring writing on par with a fourth grader&#8217;s creative writing assignment (see: every joke any character ever tries to make).  But somehow, I can&#8217;t stop watching this show, and actually enjoy it.  Part of <em>Greek&#8217;s</em> hold on me can be attributed to a concept the show&#8217;s writer&#8217;s have no grasp on: timing.  Being in college myself, the series allows me a chance to compare my experiences with those of the characters, while offering me an outlet to compare my views of university life with those of the entertainment industry.  I love <em>Greek</em> because no other show simultaneously butchers what college life is like while also somehow nailing what it&#8217;s like to be at an institute of higher learning.  </p><p><em>Greek</em> kicked off its second season earlier this week, and I want to follow the sophomore season of this show on this blog, focusing mostly on how well it captures the college experience.  For those unfamiliar with the show, I direct you to the ever-helpful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Greek_%28TV_series%29_characters">Wikipedia page for all the characters</a>, which should help you figure out who is who and what&#8217;s going on.  Here are the most important issues as season two begins: Casey Cartwright, the president of the ZBZ sorority, has been dumped by the president of the preppy Omega Chi Delta frat Evan Chambers.  She also may still have feelings for Cappie, head of the slobby frat and her one-time boyfriend (key info: this is the central relationship to the show, the questions of whether the two will end up together always lingering in the air).  Meanwhile, Casey&#8217;s brother Rusty dumped his girlfriend right before the school break.  Why, you ask?  Because she wrote a big ol&#8217; controversial article about the Greek scene, and now the community faces intense scrutiny heading into a new semester.  Clear?  Let&#8217;s go to&#8230;..</p><p><strong>Quick Episode Summary: &#8220;The New Normal&#8221;</strong></p><p><em><a href="http://abcfamily.go.com/abcfamily/path/section_Shows+Greek/page_Video-Greek_Full_1011G">View the episode online</a></em></p><p>The Cartwrights return to made-up Cyprus-Rhodes College, both facing just-ended relationships and Greek community controversy.  Cappie has been hooking up with ZBZ member and Casey&#8217;s arch-rival Rebecca Logan over the break, but both agree it is just a &#8220;fling.&#8221;  Casey convinces the Panhellenic Council to hold a &#8220;Back-to-School Carnival&#8221; for charity to help improve the Greek community&#8217;s image.  Meanwhile, her house welcomes an unexpected visitor in Lizzie, a representative from the national chapter, who has been assigned to follow the progress of the chapter.  She becomes a pain in the house, enforcing archaic rules and generally making the place less cool.  Rusty can&#8217;t get over his ex-girlfriend, but frat bro Cappie urges him to erase her from his life and spend more time with &#8220;his bros.&#8221;  Casey, who claimed to be over Evan, realizes she still loves him.  Rusty confronts his former flame, only to discover she has moved on to a new boy, rattling Rusty who quickly tells her off.  The carnival happens (featuring a concert by Plain White T&#8217;s!), and ZBZ&#8217;s kissing booth flounders, since the girls are dressed like &#8220;the Amish.&#8221;  Cappie notices Casey&#8217;s predicament, and convinces all his fraternity brothers to contribute to the booth.  Cappie kisses Casey, a scene Rebecca notices and immediately walks away from.  Evan sees this as well, and tells Casey they are completely done.  Rusty and Casey share a brother-sister moment where they admit they are both still not over their former loves.</p><p><strong>Representation of College</strong></p><p>- I&#8217;m always stunned how <em>Greek</em> tends to capture the small details of university life so well.  New thorn-in-the-side of ZBZ Lizzie banned clapping during chapter meetings, instituting a &#8220;snaps&#8221; policy instead.  I would have thought such a move to be ridiculous&#8230;except numerous sorority girls at NU have told me they &#8220;snap&#8221; during meetings.  I guess this is a trend, and props to <em>Greek</em> for noticing it.</p><p>- What the show usually messes up are larger representations of college life for the sake of simplicity towards the&#8230;uhhhh&#8230;.slower viewer.  The frats in the world of <em>Greek</em> each differ drastically: you got your preppy house (look, they wear suits and are nearly all white!), your slob house (look, they wear casual clothes and have an Asian dude!), and your nerdy house (look, nerds!).  I don&#8217;t think frat houses in real life are so obvious, they tend to have a fair smattering of all types.  Or maybe NU&#8217;s really unique.  I doubt that.</p><p>- My biggest gripe with the show during season one was the unwavering championing of Greek life.  In this week&#8217;s episode, the writers actually turned the letter-covered paddle on the Greek community, at least by accident.  Casey&#8217;s rationale behind a carnival: Giving money to charity looks really good.  I&#8217;ve always thought Greek philanthropy exists primarily as a way to boost up a house&#8217;s image in the community, and the people behind <em>Greek</em> also picked up on the fact most Greek charity isn&#8217;t just about doing good.  <a href="../../2008/03/8230/a-little-less-luster-a-reflection-on-dm-2008/index.html">Hmmmm, this sounds familiar</a>&#8230;  </p><p>- Why would so many students come back to campus a week before classes start?</p><p>- I&#8217;ve heard of some wacky parties, but a Kama Sutra mixer takes the cleavage-filled cake.  They don&#8217;t even try for innuendo!</p><p>- Rusty&#8217;s storyline about being absolutely crushed and consumed by his ex was done very well, and actually made me pause the episode at several points just so I could regain myself.  I&#8217;ve been in Rusty&#8217;s shoes before (and, unnecessary personal aside, am sorta in them right now), so his despair struck me as really well done.  Especially the first awkward interaction between the former couple (which also applied to Evan and Casey&#8217;s first meeting) &#8211; this show actually knows what awkward is all about.</p><p>- Plain White T&#8217;s have now played fraternity events three times during the show&#8217;s run.  That just doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p><p><strong><em>Greek&#8217;s</em> Bad Writing in Action</strong></p><p>- &#8220;Bros and Cheeseoritos before Hos.&#8221;  Forget the lame cliche saying, but Cheeseoritos?  Really?  You can&#8217;t think of a more creative name for a snack food besides the bastard title of Cheeze-Its slammed together with Doritos?</p><p>- &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say I haven&#8217;t been in a position to notice the poster until now.&#8221;  Get it?  She was riding him during sex, so she couldn&#8217;t see the ceiling!  Bonus stupid points for having Rebecca raise her eyebrows on the word &#8220;position,&#8221; to drive home the fact this went down during intercourse.</p><p>- Character Issues: Rusty&#8217;s hyper-religious roommate, Dale, sported a &#8220;<a href="http://www.pimpyourshirts.com/catalog/hugitblue.jpg">Let&#8217;s Hug it Out </a>(Bitch?)&#8221; t-shirt early on in the episode.  I feel someone as uber-Bibley as him wouldn&#8217;t wear this shirt, let alone know what <em>Entourage</em> is.</p><p>- ZBZ comment about how her dress makes her look Amish: No dear, <a href="http://blogs.newamericamedia.org/images/263.jpg">this is Amish</a>.  You look like a librarian.  C&#8217;mon people, respect the Amish for once.</p><p><strong>Closing Question &#8211; How long can the writers possibly milk the Casey-Cappie drama before something has to happen? Also, why would anyone have a Say Anything poster in their house?  People like them?</strong></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
