This week, it&rsquo;s everything from Dillo to Kylie Jenner. Transcript below.</p><iframe scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/318646770&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" frameborder="no" height="660px" width="660px"></iframe><p>Carrie Twersky: Hello, welcome to Whine Time. I&rsquo;m Carolyn Twersky, you can call me Carrie. I am a junior journalism student, also majoring in sociology. I&rsquo;m from Connecticut and I was recently mistaken for Kendall Jenner by a homeless man on the Davis L stop.</p><p>Dani Cohen: I&rsquo;m Danielle Cohen, but you can call me Dani. I&rsquo;m a sophomore majoring in journalism, minoring in theater studies and working toward a certificate in Integrated Marketing Communications. I&rsquo;m from New York and last weekend I only cried twice because I wasn&rsquo;t getting enough attention at my sister&rsquo;s bat mitzvah.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, so welcome to NBN&rsquo;s first ever pop culture podcast.</p><p>Dani: Here, we&rsquo;re going to talk about everything from Dillo headliner&rsquo;s to Kendall Jenner&rsquo;s Pepsi commercial.</p><p>Carrie: We&rsquo;re also going to be interviewing campus celebrities, playing games and hopefully making your walk down Sheridan Road a little more enjoyable.</p><p>Dani: Today&rsquo;s word of the day is &ldquo;literally&rdquo;. That means that every time you hear us say the word literally we want you to drink. You can drink whatever you want.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, so we&rsquo;re drinking some wine juice boxes.</p><p>Dani: I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m allowed to say that I&rsquo;m drinking because I&rsquo;m 20, but I am.</p><p>Carrie: Sorry mom. Ok, so our first topic is Dillo. So Mayfest just announced that Gramatik is the first headliner. Was it headliner?</p><p>Dani: I guess, but apparently Gramatik is like the second to last person going up, which means it &ndash; and I say it because I literally thought Gramatik was like a mathematical symbol. Gramatik is the second to last person to go up for Dillo, which means it&rsquo;s the second most important person, which really terrifies me.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, so wait so in relation to last year, who was that last year?</p><p>Dani: I don&rsquo;t know because I only made it to Schoolboy Q last year and I don&rsquo;t even know if that&rsquo;s his correct name. I literally knew one song.</p><p>Carrie: I did not even make it to Schoolboy Q, so congratulations.</p><p>Dani: Did you make it to anything?</p><p>Carrie: I went to the Mowgli&rsquo;s.</p><p>Dani: Ok, so that&rsquo;s pretty good. I napped for like 50% of Dillo so like end of the day, what we need to be asking is how much do these people actually matter?</p><p>Carrie: Ok, but I actually listened to his stuff. Him? Her? Them? I don&rsquo;t know. And I kind of liked it. It was kind of like jazz.</p><p>Dani: Is it like rap jazz?</p><p>Carrie: Maybe. I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Dani: I&rsquo;m doing a quick Gramatik search. Ok, he&rsquo;s Slovenian. Is that how you pronounce it?</p><p>Carrie: Yes.</p><p>Dani: A Slovenian hip hop and electronic music producer.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, so we&rsquo;re not really sure how to feel about Gramatik. Probably won&rsquo;t make it there.</p><p>Dani: What&rsquo;s more popular than Gramatik though is the new Swine &rsquo;09.</p><p>Carrie: Wow, what a transition.</p><p>Dani: I thought that was pretty flawless.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, so the norovirus is taking over Northwestern, specifically the sorority quad. I was quarantined from our sorority house over the weekend. But yeah, no so it&rsquo;s Swine &rsquo;09 all over again. Dani and I both went to camp, we both experienced Swine &rsquo;09.</p><p>Dani: I actually have a good Swine &rsquo;09 story. The night before I got it. My parents, I had a phone call with them and they were like, &ldquo;If you get Swine &rsquo;09 let us know and we will come and get you right away.&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to get Swine &rsquo;09 guys calm down.&rdquo; Six a.m. the next morning I wake up hysterically crying. My camp friend whose parents happen to own the camp has to take me to her parent&rsquo;s house because I&rsquo;m inconsolable and they take me to the health center where they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re swinin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Carrie: That sounds like a cool like&hellip;</p><p>Dani: I know.</p><p>Carrie: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re swinin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: I was literally home within 12 hours.</p><p>Carrie: That&rsquo;s insane. Well all my friends had Swine &rsquo;09 and I didn&rsquo;t, so obviously I pretended like I did and got sent home for the weekend for no reason. Just because I wanted to be part of it.</p><p>Dani: My favorite part of Swine &rsquo;09 was honestly like, I don&rsquo;t know if you guys played soccer games, but if you played soccer and you would get in a line after and high five everyone like, &ldquo;Good game, good game, good game.&rdquo; And during Swine people would put up their elbows and be like, &ldquo;Swine, Swine, Swine!&rdquo;</p><p>Carrie: That&rsquo;s so awful. That&rsquo;s so awful. Yeah, our camp gave out shirts that said, I survived, oh no, I torched the Swine because our mascot is the torch. I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;</p><p>Dani: That&rsquo;s bad.</p><p>Carrie: Fuck you!</p>
So, our next topic is the fact that Kylie Jenner is getting a show. I personally like Kylie Jenner.
<p>Dani: Unpopular opinion, I don&rsquo;t like Kylie Jenner.</p><p>Carrie: I feel like that&rsquo;s not that unpopular. I feel like a lot of people don&rsquo;t like her.</p><p>Dani: Ok, but I feel like for us.</p><p>Carrie: Do you follow her on Instagram and Snapchat?</p><p>Dani: No.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, wow. That&rsquo;s huge.</p><p>Dani: I just honestly, I feel like everyone else is at least a tad smart. I get she&rsquo;s a businesswoman, whatever, she&rsquo;s like an idiot.</p><p>Carrie: I&rsquo;m sorry lip kits? Her whole makeup line! It&rsquo;s insane!</p><p>Dani: None of that is her. None of that is her.</p><p>Carrie: She&rsquo;s making the second most amount of money and she&rsquo;s like 20. She&rsquo;s 19!</p><p>Dani: I think Kendall is easily the most talented one.</p><p>Carrie: Oh, well I am Kendall according to the homeless man at the Davis stop.</p><p>Dani: You&rsquo;re not, but she&rsquo;s so talented. She&rsquo;s a model. She has wanted to do this forever. Kylie literally just got lip implants and was like, &ldquo;Oh, ok, I&rsquo;ll do this!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know, I just, I&rsquo;m not a fan.</p><p>Carrie: Thoughts of Kylie aside, she is getting her new show, which I think is honestly not fair because Kylie Jenner has enough attention. Give her show to someone else. Give her show to us.</p><p>Dani: Well, also she&rsquo;s already on another show.</p><p>Carrie: I know. She doesn&rsquo;t need a new show. That show is going to flop in one season because no one&rsquo;s going to watch it.</p><p>Dani: It&rsquo;s not going to flop, that&rsquo;s like such a lie.</p><p>Carrie: It&rsquo;s going to flop!</p><p>Dani: No. As someone who&rsquo;s not her fan like objectively she&rsquo;s going to do super well.</p><p>Carrie: No one even watches Keeping Up with the Kardashians anymore, they&rsquo;re not going to watch her new show, too.</p><p>Dani: Do they?</p><p>Carrie: No, the ratings are definitely down.</p><p>Dani: I feel like if they streamed it on like Netflix that would be a good call.</p><p>Carrie: If it were on Netflix I would watch it all of the time.</p><p>Dani: That&rsquo;s kind of actually a call. TV is dead, you heard it here first.</p><p>Carrie: E! News, put your show on Netflix. Why are no E! shows on Netflix?</p><p>Dani: Well because I feel like a lot of it is like &ldquo;to be continued&rdquo; drama and you can&rsquo;t really do that on Netflix. Unless...</p><p>Carrie: It&rsquo;s called a cliffhanger.</p><p>Dani: Right but, there&rsquo;s no reason why they can&rsquo;t upload a video and then the next &ndash; like upload half the season and then upload the other half at another time. You know?</p><p>Carrie: No.</p><p>Dani: Like they usually upload the entire season at once, but there&rsquo;s nothing saying like Netflix you can&rsquo;t upload an entire TV show&hellip;</p><p>Carrie: Like you&rsquo;re saying people wouldn&rsquo;t wait for the whole season to come out to watch it?</p><p>Dani: No, I&rsquo;m saying it would ruin the suspense because a lot of what Keeping Up with the Kardashians is, is like waiting for the next week.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah I guess.</p><p>Dani: But there&rsquo;s no reason they can&rsquo;t do that.</p><p>Carrie: I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t watch Keeping Up with the Kardashains.</p><p>Dani: Same, so I can&rsquo;t really say.</p><p>Carrie: I mean I love&ndash;I follow all of the Kardashians. I follow their lives.</p><p>Dani: I don&rsquo;t.</p><p>Carrie: But because of that like I was there when like Kim got robbed and I lived that whole thing so I&rsquo;m not waiting five months to relive it. Like I lived it in real time.</p><p>Dani: Well, apparently like the episode, the first one &ndash; no, not even that episode came out yet. The episode that just came out is Kanye&rsquo;s breakdown.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, which is after. The episode...</p><p>Dani: No.</p><p>Carrie: Yes.</p><p>Dani: Oh you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m sorry.</p><p>Carrie: But we&rsquo;ve experienced that, like I don&rsquo;t need to experience that again.</p><p>Dani: So you think, maybe putting it on Youtube in live time? Like what&rsquo;s the&hellip;</p><p>Carrie: I don&rsquo;t know. I really don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Dani: I think maybe they ruined it for themselves.</p><p>Carrie: I think that&rsquo;s the issue with having a reality show about people who are so famous.</p><p>Dani: They kind of ruined it for themselves.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah. They Snapchat everything. They Instagram everything.</p><p>Dani: What if it was like an Instagram live sort of thing?</p><p>Carrie: No one would watch that. An hour long Instagram live story?</p><p>Dani: I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I&rsquo;m wrong.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, anyway I feel like we beat that to death.</p><p>Dani: Too hard, too hard. Let&rsquo;s go to our next topic, which is our first game. Which is: Would You Rather? Ok, our first question. Would you rather eat at Elder Dining Hall for every meal or have a class with all of your ex-hookups? I already know my answer so you go first.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, well so as someone who lived in Elder. I know you did not, but I lived in Elder for a year and I actually loved Elder dining hall because I just had waffle with Nutella on it every single day. Yes, I gained a lot of weight freshman year, whatever. But having class with all of my ex-hookups sounds like hell. So, I would go eat in Elder dining hall everyday. You know, meet some freshmen, socialize. It was like a place to hang out.</p><p>Dani: That&rsquo;s really interesting to me because honestly, this is going to sound so horrible, but I just like pretty early on rejected all dining hall food. And I tend to like &mdash; something I kind of pride myself on is that I tend to only hook up with guys that I&rsquo;m already friends with, so I would really honestly be fairly comfortable, except for one or two guys, to have a class with all my ex-hookups. It would probably be my closest guy friends.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, ok so that works for you. That&rsquo;s an easy one. Ok, so our next one is not being able to go out at all or only being able to go out to the Deuce.</p><p>Dani: I would go to the Deuce. I love the Deuce.</p><p>Carrie: But what about if you want to go out on Saturday night? You would have to go to the Deuce. You would hang out with like townies.</p><p>Dani: Well, is it like as in you would only go to the Deuce, but no one else is going?</p><p>Carrie: I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t specified. But here&rsquo;s the thing, maybe like DePaul hangs out at the Deuce on like Thursday nights &mdash; I mean Saturday nights.</p><p>Dani: Actually, I&rsquo;ll say that something I really started to appreciate this year was the ability to not go out, but still like drink and hang with friends.</p><p>Carrie: Oh my god, Dani, you&rsquo;re so cool.</p><p>Dani: I&rsquo;m really casual. Yeah, so I feel like not being able to go out at all.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, so what is the definition of going out? Going to a bar? Can you go to a friend&rsquo;s house and drink with friends?</p><p>Dani: I don&rsquo;t think you can go to like a frat. You can&rsquo;t go to a mixer.</p><p>Carrie: You can&rsquo;t go to a public place.</p><p>Dani: Yeah.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, that makes sense.</p><p>Dani: Then I&rsquo;m fine with that.</p><p>Carrie: I would say not being able to go out then. You&rsquo;d find your own fun.</p><p>Dani: Ok, our next question is: Would you rather have every class on the fourth floor of University with a broken elevator or get the norovirus?</p><p>Carrie: So ok, I think I&rsquo;m going to go with the norovirus because I&rsquo;ve had class on like a top floor of University before I knew there was an elevator when I was a freshman and it is hell. Like literally wearing your winter jacket walking up there. I was profusely sweating, heavy breathing by the time I got up there. It was awful. And also like norovirus, you know it&rsquo;s there for a few days, you get over it you know.</p><p>Dani: Honestly, I think I would say have every class on the fourth floor because, A, it&rsquo;s like you can say like oh my god I worked out, I walked to the fourth floor and back down today; and also, honestly right now we&rsquo;re on the fourth of McTrib and I walked up and down here.</p><p>Carrie: Did you actually?</p><p>Dani: Yeah, I always do when I come up here.</p><p>Carrie: Wow. I waited for the elevator and the McTrib elevator is the slowest thing you&rsquo;ve experienced in your whole entire life. It is hell.</p><p>Dani: That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve never waited for it. Next week we&rsquo;re trying to get Neha and Rose on, but honestly, like we emailed them and they haven&rsquo;t responded, so do any of you know Neha and Rose and can you ask them to respond to our emails?</p><p>Carrie: So, we also want to end this episode with a little bit of advice for the upcoming week.</p><p>Dani: This advice is brought to you by my mom. We got it right before we started this and I&rsquo;m going to quote her, &ldquo;Never let boys drink out of your butt. I see lots of stuff on I am schmucked.&rdquo; I am going to assume she means I am schmacked, but you heard it here first. So, I&rsquo;m Danielle Cohen.</p><p>Carrie: I&rsquo;m Carolyn Twersky.</p><p>Carrie and Dani: And this is NBN Audio.</p><p>Carrie: And never let boys drink out of your ass.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
