The &lsquo;Cats will have to replace the scoring of Tre Demps and the size of Alex Olah, but with a more difficult non-conference schedule, added depth and key versatility, NU seems to be headed in the right direction. Will this be the year that the Wildcats take the next step?</p><p><strong>Will Fischer:</strong> 17-14 (7-11 B1G), NIT Second Round</p><p>The Wildcats will have an impressive start to the year, going 10-3 in conference play and knocking off Butler in the third game of the season. But Big Ten play will prove too tough for the young &lsquo;Cats, and the lack of big men depth and experience in sophomore Dererk Pardon and freshman Barret Benson could be disastrous, especially if injuries occur.</p><p>NU has lots of versatility and athletic pieces, but behind Bryant McIntosh, no one is extremely skilled. The &lsquo;Cats should be able to knock off a team or two in conference play, and better wins will get them a NIT invite, which Collins should accept. NU will win its first postseason game in a while in the first round of the NIT, an important step for a team that returns most of its key players next season.</p><p>The pieces look better, but NU is still at least a year away from the NCAA Tournament. Simply put, most of the players are unpolished and need more time to develop. Playing at Allstate Arena next season with a hungry senior McIntosh, the &lsquo;Cats will have their best chance yet at the big dance - but will anyone be there to see it?</p><p><strong>Hayden King:</strong> 19-12 (9-9 B1G), NIT Second Round</p><p>There will be games this season that slip out of the men&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s grasp. A lack of interior depth and elite perimeter defending will cause problems for this Northwestern team in crunch time. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if foul trouble becomes an early storyline, especially against experienced teams like Butler and athletic teams like Texas.</p><p>However, there will be games this season where the &lsquo;Cats are firing on all cylinders: using their own athleticism to force turnovers, running in transition and hitting threes. This is the most lovable NU team in recent memory. It is going to be a treat to watch Bryant McIntosh sling passes around the floor with ease, to watch Isiah Brown, Barret Benson and the rest of the freshman class fit into their new roles, to watch two ESPN 100 recruits in Vic Law and Aaron Falzon finally share the floor.</p><p>This may not be the year, but Collins finally has his team. They may turn on and off like a flickering light, but enjoy the flashes. This iteration is only a glimpse into a much brighter future.</p><p><strong>Trevor Lystad:</strong> 25-6 (12-6 B1G), NCAA Tournament Round of 32</p><p>It will be the year.</p><p>Bryant McIntosh will make a legitimate case for best point guard in the Big Ten (and one of the best in the nation), Vic Law will dominate in his return from injury and Isiah Brown will be a freshman sensation who represents a bright future in Evanston.</p><p>With the loss of departing senior and leading scorer Tre Demps, McIntosh will have to be &ldquo;the guy&rdquo; even more than last year, and he won&rsquo;t disappoint. Additionally, expect the freshman Brown (who shined in the exhibition) to provide an impressive scoring spark off the bench &ndash; and to work his way into the starting lineup by the time conference play rolls around.</p><p>The &lsquo;Cats will roll over a few easy opponents to start the season before firmly planting themselves in Top 25 consideration when they beat preseason No. 21 Texas on Nov. 25, and they won&rsquo;t lose a game until they have to play at Michigan State at the end of December. Big upsets over Maryland and Indiana at the end of the season will solidify their first ever tournament appearance &ndash; before Kentucky beats them by 50 in the Round of 32.</p><p><strong>Max Goodman:</strong> 20-11 (10-8 B1G), NIT Second Round</p><p>The quest for head coach Chris Collins and the Northwestern men&rsquo;s basketball team to make the NCAA Tournament is once again set to get underway. With junior co-captain Bryant McIntosh taking the lead, along with rising star sophomore big man Dererk Pardon on defense and freshman standout Isiah Brown off the bench, the &lsquo;Cats will find their stride in non-conference play &ndash; falling to the likes of Butler, Texas and Dayton but entering Big Ten play with a 10-3 record.</p><p>But similar to last year&rsquo;s campaign, NU will have trouble winning the games that would push them into the NCAA tourney. The Wildcats have the talent and personnel to take care of business in all the games that they should win, but I just don&rsquo;t think this young group is ready to pull off upsets against Michigan State, Indiana or Wisconsin. That being said, the &lsquo;Cats will finish the season 20-11 and earn themselves a high seed in the NIT tournament, where they&rsquo;ll reach the Sweet Sixteen.</p><p>Although this year will be undoubtedly disappointing for Wildcat fans, who&rsquo;ll have to watch March Madness without cheering on their team for another year, I think NU should use this season to grow and strive toward their goal. With young players developing, and key contributors like B-Mac, Scottie Lindsey and Gavin Skelly entering their senior year in 2017, Wildcat fans will end up saying &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always next year&rdquo; &nbsp;but for once it&rsquo;ll be the truth.</p><p><strong>Evan Denton:</strong> 18-13 (9-9 B1G), NIT First Round</p><p>No Demps, no Olah, no Ivanauskas, oh my! The men&rsquo;s team finds themselves looking in the mirror and asking, &ldquo;Is this finally the year?&rdquo; The return of Vic Law gives NU another versatile wing player that can slash to the basket. Point guard Bryant McIntosh is in the conversation as one of the B1G&rsquo;s best, and Dererk Pardon ended last year on a high note. However, no one on Northwestern&rsquo;s roster can create his own shot, which will hurt the &lsquo;Cats down the stretch.</p><p>In the non-conference, a road game at Butler on Nov. 16 is definitely a loss, and NU should just hope it loses by less than 20. Elsewhere, neutral site games against Texas, Notre Dame/Colorado and Dayton are games that a NCAA Tournament caliber team should win&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not Northwestern. The Wildcats will go 9-4 in non-conference, but without any signature wins.</p><p>A strong conference start is crucial for the Wildcats, as four of Northwestern&rsquo;s first five B1G games are on the road, but they fortunately include Penn State and Rutgers. Indiana, my prediction to win the B1G, comes to Evanston on Jan. 29, and I think that will be the upset of the year for the Cats.</p><p><strong>Tim Hackett:</strong> 12-19 (5-13 B1G), No Postseason</p><p>Is this finally the year that Northwestern men&rsquo;s basketball reaches the NCAA Tournament?</p><p>No. It isn&rsquo;t. There has been some optimism about this team&rsquo;s prospects, as there has been in many recent years, but this year&rsquo;s team will finish a few steps out of the big dance. The Wildcats could contend for the NIT or one of those other tournaments no one knows or cares about, but, knowing Chris Collins, he will most likely not accept the bid, leaving Northwestern out of the postseason once again.</p><p>NU struggled with depth scoring last year. Tre Demps and Alex Olah were first and third on the team, respectively, in points per game. They&rsquo;re both gone. Someone, and preferably multiple someones, will have to step up to lighten the load of Bryant McIntosh. Having Vic Law back and healthy will unquestionably be beneficial, but seeing some better play from Scottie Lindsey and Sanjay Lumpkin, just to name a few, would be helpful.</p><p>Also, Olah was occasionally excellent but usually solid. Who will replace him down low? Is sophomore Dererk Pardon the answer? I have no idea. But Northwestern needs some big man help from someone if they hope to match up with some other Big Ten teams that are loaded at the position.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
