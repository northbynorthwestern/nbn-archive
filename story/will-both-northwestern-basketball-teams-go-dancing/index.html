It's fairly common knowledge that the men's team is still in search of its first NCAA Tournament bid. The women's team, on the other hand, broke through last year for their first date in The Big Dance since 1997 and returns almost all the great players that got them there. The men do, however, appear to be headed to the Promised Land ... eventually(?), despite the loss of Vic Law this year. So that beckons the question,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>will both Northwestern basketball teams go dancing this season?</strong></em></span><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em><strong></strong>Our writers weighed in:</p><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/11/10/IMG_0620.JPG" /><div class="caption">Photo by Daniel Hersh / North by Northwestern</div></div><p><em>Will Fischer says&nbsp;</em><strong>"</strong><strong>No"</strong></p><p>While the women&rsquo;s team is (dare I say it) a lock for the tournament this year, the men&rsquo;s team will not dance this year &ndash; although they are getting closer and closer.</p><p><strong>Women&rsquo;s team:</strong> 24-8, NCAA Sweet 16</p><p>Ranked No. 19 in the nation, this women&rsquo;s team is NU&rsquo;s best in recent history. Nia Coffey once beat Michael Jordan in a game of one-on-one, Chris Kyle taught Maggie Lyon how to shoot, and Ashley Deary once raced a cheetah &ndash; and won. What more do you need to see to be convinced?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Men&rsquo;s team:</strong> 18-13, no postseason tournament</p><p>While this will be a season of improvement, going 9-9 in the Big Ten, the &lsquo;Cats are not yet ready for the dance. They will get an NIT invitation, but Coach Chris Collins will dramatically decline it, screaming &ldquo;NO&rdquo; repeatedly for six hours and crying himself to sleep. Maybe next year.</p><p><em>Andy Brown says </em><strong>"</strong><strong>No"</strong></p><p>Although the pieces are in place for both teams to make a run, the men still have one more notch to climb up. The women, on the other hand, have climbed that ladder and should continue to bask in the glow at the top.</p><p><strong>Women's team:</strong> 26-6, NCAA Sweet 16</p><p>After last year's disappointing finish against the Arkansas Razorbacks in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, these 'Cats are likely feeling hog-wild (yeah) about getting back to the Dance and going farther. Ashley Deary and Nia Coffey, who could probably join up to form some sort of mega-person, are still only juniors, and those two, combined with sharpshooter Maggie "Snake Venom" Lyon, should lead an electric offense. Joe McKeown is a proven winner, and this team is built to make things interesting in March.</p><p><strong>Men's team:</strong> 17-14, NIT Second Round</p><p>Give credit to Chris Collins: he has successfully compiled enough talent to warrant some raised eyebrows around the Big Ten. Will he break NU's historic drought with the young core group he's got now? I say yes, but this is not "The Year." Despite a weak non-conference schedule, NU will probably lose a couple of winnable games early, and are unlikely to crack .500 in conference play. That said, 8-10 in the B1G and an NIT run would be huge steps forward. 2016-17? That's "The Year." I stand by that wholeheartedly.</p><p><em>Austin Siegel says</em>&nbsp;<strong>"Yes"</strong></p><p>Northwestern is awesome. We've got lakefront property, an engaging student body and Dillo Day (usually). Basketball is awesome. You've got dunks, bounce passes and the one Cleveland sports team nobody can tease me about. Except for a long time, it was important to keep "Northwestern" and "Basketball" as far away from each other as possible. Because then you got stuck with "Northwestern Basketball" and that made everyone sad.</p><p>But not anymore.</p><p><strong>Women's team:</strong>&nbsp;23-9, NCAA Round of 32</p><p>It can be genuinely upsetting when the visiting point guard is introduced at Welsh-Ryan Arena, because she has no idea that she's in for 40 minutes of the Ashley Deary experience. The 'Cats junior point guard is the perfect metaphor for this team. A little undersized but technically sound, she's willing to outwork you, even if she has to go to double overtime to do it. It's going to take NU some time to adjust to life without a front court presence like Alex Cohen, but this squad can just beat you in so many ways. Ohio State and Maryland are still standing in the way of a conference championship, but if the Wildcats can pull off just one upset, it might be enough to set them up for a deep run come March.</p><p><strong>Men's team:</strong> 19-12, NCAA First Round</p><p>Yep. These guys lost a couple heartbreakers last season, so I think they were actually a little better than their record indicated. Returning all their starters, I think the 'Cats can make a four game improvement and get themselves squarely onto the bubble. It's going to take continued progression from Bryant McIntosh and freshman Aaron Falzon, but I think this is the year NU does that thing we always talked about. Add Tre Demps into the mix (who gives the 'Cats a shot in every game) and you've got three players that any team in the nation would love to have. Northwestern had a 10-game losing streak a year ago and still sniffed the NIT. With a maturing group of talented players, I think the Wildcats decide to run before they can walk. All the way to the NCAA tournament.</p><p><em>Tim Hackett says&nbsp;</em><b>"No"</b></p><p><strong>Women's team:</strong> 22-10, NCAA Sweet 16</p><p>Despite building on the success of last year's regular season, the women's team won't see their persistence pay off in the regular season, taking a small step back from their 23-9 finish last year, including an upset loss at home to metro-area rival DePaul. But despite the slight statistical setback, the Wildcats will succeed in the long run, with a first round rout in the NCAA Tournament to avenge last year's loss, followed by a close win in the second round. The 'Cats will finally meet their match in the form of a simply superior opponent which will end Northwestern's season, respectably, in the third round.</p><p><strong>Men's team:</strong> 18-13, NIT First Round</p><p>The men's team would be lucky to even get that far. Still searching for their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance, the 2015-2016 season will end with the Wildcats just missing the cut yet again. There will be simply too many losses and not enough quality wins to help them sneak in as a low seed. But hey, this is "Chicago's Big Ten Team," so fans should take a page out of the Chicago sports fan's book: just you wait until next year!</p><p><em>Jason Mast says&nbsp;</em><strong>"No"</strong></p><p><strong>Women's team:</strong> 10-22, :(</p><p>Sports can make even the most hardened rationalist believe in Karma, and this year, it will doom women&rsquo;s basketball. Ashley Deary is simply too deceptive. Sure, the Wildcat women burned Seton Hill like kindling 103-44 on Sunday, but Deary captured 10 steals. As a freshman, Northwestern&rsquo;s version of Isiah Thomas &ndash; in position, playing style, and height &ndash; finished fourth in the Big Ten in steals. She ranked second as a sophomore, and if Sunday&rsquo;s performance is any indication, she will lead the conference this season, an accomplishment that will likely anger the sports gods. Call it Karma, divine retribution, cosmic voodoo, whatever, but stealing doesn&rsquo;t pay for the playoffs. The two greatest thieves in NBA history - John Stockton and Jason Kidd - are also two of the most accomplished stars to never win a championship. The last player to lead the NBA in steals and win a ring was Michael Jordan, in 1993. Ashley Deary is talented, but she&rsquo;s not Michael Jordan, and the Wildcats are in for an early offseason.</p><p><strong>Men's team:</strong>&nbsp;16-15, no postseason tournament</p><p>Meanwhile the men&rsquo;s team is unlikely to lead the conference in any major statistical category, but their fortunes should be little better. Coach K needed four seasons to make the Blue Devils dance, but not even this apprentice can surpass the best master in NCAA history. Tre Demps has the potential for a breakout senior season, and Indiana head coach Tom Crean called him an NBA draft prospect after he dropped 23 points on them last year, but it's the young core that will ultimately be the 'Cats' downfall in 2015-16.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
