The date is Nov. 8, 2014. At 2:35 p.m., Michigan&rsquo;s Matt Wile kicks a football into a dark blue late afternoon sky. What follows are roughly three hours of an unsightly 10-9 Michigan win over Northwestern that, like it or not, will be seared in the memories of all fans in attendance for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Between the two teams, there were six turnovers, less than 600 yards of total offense and quarterback ratings of 6.0 and 36.6, for Michigan&rsquo;s Devin Gardner and Northwestern&rsquo;s Trevor Siemian, respectively. It was, objectively, a very, very poorly played football game, and due to the scoreless first half, was henceforth known as &ldquo;The M00N Game.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>In commemoration of the two-year anniversary of the debacle, NBN was able to round up nine from a crowd of 42,429 witnesses of these crimes against football who were willing to give their accounts of that fateful Saturday. Their stories of hope, frustration, love and loss, intertwined with video clips, our live tweets and photos of the &ldquo;action,&rdquo; are a work of abstract art as difficult to interpret as M00N itself. Let&rsquo;s travel two years back, to a date which will live in infamy.</p><p><em>(Note: all sources quoted in this story are identified by their title at the time that M00N was played).&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Pregame expectations</strong></p><p><strong>Jason Ferry, Weinberg freshman:</strong> &ldquo;I thought we might be overmatched. I didn't expect a lot, but didn't expect [what I saw]. I did not think it would be the worst game I've ever witnessed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Antonio James, defensive graduate assistant, Michigan:</strong> &ldquo;We knew that [the team] knew what Northwestern was capable of &hellip; They were gonna play you to the wire, they&rsquo;re tough. Our players knew that, so though they were confident, they were also very aware of the challenge at hand.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cameron Songer, Medill senior, WNUR play-by-play broadcaster:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;You never expect such a low scoring game. At that late point in the season, you don't expect a sloppy one either, but as I prepared to broadcast the game, I tried to prepare for anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kevin Koger, offensive graduate assistant, Michigan:</strong> &ldquo;Near Chicago there&rsquo;s a big Michigan contingent, so we knew we&rsquo;d have a lot of fans at the game, so that always helps. We said all week it was going to feel like a home game for us, and it kind of did. We had a lot of fans in there, like we expected.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Soto Dedes, College of Engineering freshman, Michigan:</strong> &ldquo;I thought the game was going to be a struggle given the fact that our team had struggled with every single team except for Appalachian State, but I felt somewhat confident that we would win simply because we had better athletes and depth at each position compared to Northwestern.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Koger:</strong> &ldquo;Selfishly, as an offensive guy, you go into a game saying &lsquo;we&rsquo;re going to score all these points!&rsquo; so we were fairly confident that we could put points on the board. Northwestern didn&rsquo;t do a ton on defense, but what they did, they did very well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah, we'll take the rock to start!

It validated my leaving &ndash; like 'yes, I made the correct decision.'"</p><p><strong>Koger:</strong> &ldquo;[When Trevor Siemian slipped], I just smiled and took my headset off. It was just a sense of relief that we played so poorly but still won the game. We came out with a hard fought win even though we didn&rsquo;t play very well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>James:</strong>&nbsp;"Really I can&rsquo;t say it was more than luck that Siemian didn&rsquo;t get the two-point conversion &ndash; when you watch the replay, he had his options. Frank Clark got off the ball phenomenally, and that quarterback slipping really helped us.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><iframe src="https://vine.co/v/OeYaM6YJbi7/embed/simple" width="660" height="440" frameborder="0"></iframe><script type="mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-mce-text/javascript" src="https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"></script><p><strong>The Aftermath</strong></p><p><strong>Jason Ferry:</strong> &ldquo;It was just a mess. And the fact that we had a chance to win at the end was hilarious &hellip; I don't think I'll ever forget that game. I always heard about being a Northwestern fan, but that summed up what I expected it to be. It was like a hyperbole.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> &ldquo;It was like a cartoon version of [Northwestern fanhood].&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mike Ferry:</strong> &ldquo;It was frustrating. I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, so I hate all things Michigan.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Todd:</strong> &ldquo;My dad, [a Michigan law school grad who is from Michigan], said afterwards, &lsquo;no team deserved to win that game.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dedes: "</strong>I was not satisfied with that win. Whenever I look back at the season I count that game as a loss. Sometimes I actually have to be reminded that we won that game because I assume we lost."</p><p><strong>Pleva: "</strong>It was a waste of time. That game was a waste of time. I didn't even feel emotions because of the team, I was like 'what the hell is this?'"</p><p><br /><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2016/11/07/Michigerwe1.JPG" /></p><p><strong>James:</strong> &ldquo;It was a tough win, and a big defensive win. Their defense came to play, our defense came to play, and you don&rsquo;t forget those types of games and situations. That was also my wife&rsquo;s first game to be able to come and see me as a Michigan coach, so that was a special moment, as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Koger:</strong> &ldquo;&hellip; you&rsquo;re not satisfied with the way the offense played or the team played, but you have to keep it in perspective that you did win a Big Ten football game. And you never want to diminish the fact that you won the football game, but were we satisfied? Absolutely not. It was kind of bittersweet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Songer:</strong> &ldquo;I had tickets [to the Notre Dame game] and considered selling them out of frustration with Northwestern, but eventually decided that anything could happen, and, at the least, it would be entertaining in a morbid way. That obviously ended up being the better game to broadcast.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dedes:&nbsp;</strong>"I remember seeing a guy dressed in Michigan and Northwestern gear with a sign that said 'I want both teams to win' and thinking to myself how disappointed he must be that both teams lost. That was the worst game of football I have ever seen and I hope I never see anything like it again."</p><p><em>Fittingly enough, our send-off tweet for the night had a typo in it. This tweet, like football, sports and, eventually, all of human civilization, will eventually fade into the minutia of history. From gold to dust, if you will. But much like The M00N Game, we can never go back and fix it. And even if we could fix it, why would we want to destroy something so perfect, just to make it beautiful?</em></p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank for watching, this has been the worst football game in the history of the sport.</p>
