Photo courtesy of boboroshi on Flickr, licensed under Creative Commons.</div><p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what I was expecting. All I knew was that I was spending a decent chunk of change from my almost empty checking account to spend 16 hours on a bus and approximately nine hours in the state of Kentucky.</p><p>If I wasn&rsquo;t already questioning my decision-making, now was the time to start.</p><p>Although somewhere in the back of my mind my sensible side was yelling, &ldquo;Poor life choices!&rdquo; I consciously decided to gracefully give reasoning the middle finger and reply, &ldquo;Fuck, it&rsquo;s college. I&rsquo;ll do what I want.&rdquo;</p><p>I was attending the infamous Kentucky Derby trip hosted by Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and the two midterms I had the following week weren't going to stop me.</p><p>I definitely did not know what I was getting myself into and although I may not be able to accurately express what I expected to happen, I can (fortunately) recall what actually did.</p><p>As I rolled up to the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house via my chariot, the Intercampus Shuttle, I did not only see some "true gentlemen," but lots and lots (and lots) of girls. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been so overwhelmed by estrogen since Panhellenic recruitment. In fact, I&rsquo;m pretty positive if I cared enough to count, I would end up approximating a 3:1 ratio.</p><p>Girls on girls. Oh, wait, you wanted a hook-up this weekend? Some Derby lovin&rsquo;? Well, you&rsquo;re literally going to have to fight off the equivalent of any entire sorority in order to get some. Sorry about it.</p><p>Fortunately, I prefer not to throw myself at frat boys. I&rsquo;m not particularly lucky, and I don&rsquo;t have one particular boy waiting on the back burner. All of this meant one thing: girls' weekend.</p><p>After fighting though a mob of people, handing over a signed waiver stating SAE was not responsible for my well-beingand and settling into my seat, I decided to start this trip off with a positive attitude.</p><p>The bus ride felt surprisingly shorter than it actually was. Bad music was playing and everyone was in good spirits. In the most basic sense, it was a frat party on wheels.</p><p>Surprisingly, &ldquo;Call Me Maybe&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t played at the start of every hour. Even more surprisingly, the bus driver didn&rsquo;t want to kill himself by the first rest stop.</p><p>Of course, there were a few rumored PG-13 bus hook-ups and a few people who quickly became hot-messes, but overall it was a relatively uneventful bus ride before we stopped at a motel somewhere in Seymour, Indiana.</p><p>This was perhaps the scariest part of it all. As we drove off the highway, I saw two florescent signs beaming in the distance, &ldquo;Econolodge&rdquo; and &ldquo;Days Inn.&rdquo; Promising.</p><p>Room keys were distributed and eventually I found myself in one room with one bed and three other girls. As I walked out of the room to go find my other friends, I heard some girl say, &ldquo;We may or may not contract AIDS from sleeping here.&rdquo;</p><p>I really didn&rsquo;t have many choices. I was stuck in Bumblefuck, Indiana and I had to make the best of it. On the bright side, rumor had it that no one actually sleeps during Derby weekend. If that was the case, I could get through this.</p><p>Everyone slowly filed out of their rooms and into the parking lot. This eventually became the equivalent of a frat party in a motel parking lot. Classy. Regardless, it was a really warm night and a much-needed change of scenery. All my favorite people were collected in one place and I really couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything more. Until the two police cars drove up to our little get-together.</p><p>Cue mad dash to respective rooms.</p><p>Needless to say, this put a damper on the rest of the night. I assume most people did what I did: I took a five second shower, put on some PJs and went to sleep. And while Friday night ended up being a little bit of a disappointment, I would soon find out that it was probably for the best.</p><p>We had to be back on the buses at 8 a.m. the next morning. To whoever decided that this was a good idea I want to extend a &ldquo;fuck you.&rdquo; This may seem a little harsh, however, I have absolutely no idea why someone would think I would want to spend three hours in a parking lot before spending another seven hours at the Kentucky Derby itself.&nbsp;Decisions on how to spend those three hours before the racetrack doors opened were wholly personal. Some chose to chat and mingle and others actively decided to go completely bat-shit crazy. My personal favorite was the couple making out for a good hour in the middle of this all. It was literally nine in the morning, y&rsquo;all needed to calm down.</p><p>Thankfully, I narrowly escaped having to take care of anyone that day. What I didn&rsquo;t escape was getting sunburnt and perhaps the more awkward farmer&rsquo;s tan of my life. Apparently it hit almost 90 degrees on Saturday and operating at the Northwestern-level of intelligence that we are, no one thought to bring sunscreen.</p><p>The day itself was broken up by mint juleps, turkey legs, huddling in a tent to escape the sun and getting blatantly hit on by 40 year olds dressed in Vineyard Vines.</p><p>Perhaps you may have noticed the lack of the words &ldquo;horses&rdquo; and &ldquo;jockeys&rdquo; and &ldquo;race&rdquo; in this narrative. That&rsquo;s because during my nine-hour stay in the State of Kentucky, the only horse I saw was a bronze statue that stood in front of the Churchill Downs entrance. As much as I promised myself that this year I would see the race, it just didn&rsquo;t happen for me.</p><p>All in all, I would say the Kentucky Derby trip is one for your Northwestern bucket list. The experience may vary every year, but staying in a shitty motel, spending essentially two days on a bus, and eating fast food for every meal throughout the entirety of the weekend is something that everyone needs to experience. Sure, it&rsquo;s not classy or even sanitary but sometimes you just need to graciously give reasoning the middle finger and say, &ldquo;Fuck it, it&rsquo;s college, I&rsquo;ll do what I want.&rdquo;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
