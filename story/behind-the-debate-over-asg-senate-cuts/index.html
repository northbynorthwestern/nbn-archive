Many were ASG senators, and five or six were reporters. The forum may have lacked ASG-unaffiliated students &#8212; but that was just fine for those in attendance, as the discussion quickly morphed into a small-scale word skirmish between supporters and opponents of the plan.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what to take away from the two-hour debate:</p><div class="quote_box">FMO Senator Justin Clarke said linking senators with student groups ensured that students had a trusted advocate in government. &#8220;As a senator, I was elected from my constituency. They know me. I know them.&#8221;</div><p><strong>1. The plan in a nutshell:</strong> Lew and a handful of other students have been working since January on a proposal to reduce the number of ASG senators from 49 to 20, and to elect them all via campus-wide &#8212; or &#8220;at-large&#8221; &#8212; elections. That&#8217;s a big break from the current system, in which senators represent four major caucuses: dorms, Greek houses, off-campus residences and a limited number of student groups.</p><p>Lew said there are a few problems with the present system. For one, not all students have the same number of senators &#8212; the more student groups call you their own, the more representation you have. Second, there is no single process for choosing senators: Some are elected, some win approval from executive boards and others are appointed. </p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very subjective representation,&#8221; said Weinberg senior Ben Armstrong, the Political Union co-president who served on the committee that developed the proposal. He said he didn&#8217;t understand why ASG chose to remain a body of collected interest groups, rather than a democracy in which all students cast an equal number of votes.</p><p>There are 15 student group senators, and every student group that wants a seat must apply for it each year. Lew said the process &#8220;alienates and ignores&#8221; groups that are not chosen. &#8220;Who&#8217;s to say that one student organization is more important than another?&#8221; she said after the meeting.</p><p><strong>2. What would happen to minority group representation?</strong> A number of the student leaders in attendance worried that cutting student group seats from Senate would lessen their access to student government. Weinberg senior Nissi Orgill, head of African-American student alliance For Members Only, opposed the proposal, saying she thought it would rob student group members of a &#8220;personal buy-in&#8221; with ASG.</p><p>FMO Senator Justin Clarke said linking senators with student groups ensured that students had a trusted advocate in government. &#8220;As a senator, I was elected from my constituency. They know me. I know them.&#8221; Some attendees feared that at-large elections would disenfranchise voters from smaller demographics &#8212; like African-American students and those active in theater.</p><div class="quote_box">What makes ASG different? The power of the purse &#8212; yours, specifically. Each year, Senate distributes around $1 million in student activity fee money to fund student group budgets.</div><p>Many students called 20 an &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; number of senators, saying that it would <em>limit</em>, rather than expand, voter representation. Weinberg senior Reed Wilson, the whip of the off-campus caucus, said that the current system ensures that every student has at least one senator to represent them. &#8220;Whether they take advantage of that representation is an entirely different matter,&#8221; he said. </p><p><strong>3. No matter what you say about ASG, they still have your money.</strong> Top-level student planning is a crowded field. There&#8217;s the Undergraduate Budget Priorities Committee, which lobbies the university for funding on <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/ubpc/outcomes.html">special projects</a> &#8212; think Fran&#8217;s Cafe and the Saturday inter-campus shuttle. Then there are the student advisory boards, which work on each school&#8217;s curricula. And, of course, there&#8217;s Deru, plotting snowball fights, senior events and more from the shadows. </p><p>What makes ASG different? The power of the purse &#8212; yours, specifically. Each year, Senate distributes nearly $1 million in student activity fee money to fund student group budgets. A&#038;O Chair and former ASG senator Barry McCardel called the job &#8220;one of the most important duties of the Senate.&#8221; </p><p>McCardel said he believes it&#8217;s vital to choose senators who know how to fund student groups. A&#038;O and Mayfest, who share a senator, brought in more than $400,000 from ASG last year. &#8220;Many of the most involved, proactive senators come from student groups,&#8221; he said. </p><p>Given senators&#8217; deep ties to their student groups, it seems unlikely that many would be happy to part so severely from the status quo. They stand to lose too much in a total remake of the system: representation, clout, maybe even money.</p><p><strong>4. But supporters of the proposal could bypass the Senate entirely.</strong> Lew says she&#8217;ll be meeting with student leaders over the next few days to talk about the proposal. And she says she still wants to have legislation ready for Wednesday&#8217;s Senate meeting. She has consistently said that this proposal is merely that &#8212; an idea that she wants the Senate to examine.</p><p>Nobody has to look to the Senate at all, though. The <a href="http://asg.northwestern.edu/documents/Code.pdf">ASG Code</a> allows for bills to head straight to campus-wide referendum &#8212; that&#8217;s Section 608.4.3, if you care. All it takes is a petition of 200 undergraduate signatures. After that, the going could be easy. Armstrong believes that the student body, faced with a yes-or-no vote on the 20-member proposal, would choose to sweep away the current Senate.</p><div class="quote_box">&#8220;What I would hate to see,&#8221; McCardel said, is groups checking out of the debate. He called for &#8220;a wider conversation about how ASG can be fixed in general.&#8221;</div><p>Internally, of course, that could be a political disaster. ASG would trash its relationship with major student groups like FMO, A&#038;O, Mayfest, NCDC and the theater boards &#8212; all of whom value their near-guaranteed senatorial link to student government. Not to mention the senators themselves, who would suddenly find themselves out of a job &#8212; and would have to explain to future employers why they landed on the wrong end of a minor campus revolution. </p><p><strong>5. It&#8217;s not clear <em>what</em> people want to change.</strong> Armstrong certainly stands behind the proposal. For him, it&#8217;s about democracy &#8212; ensuring that all students have equal votes and equal representation. His ideal ASG Senate is a &#8220;popularly-elected Deru,&#8221; a small team of upperclassman student leaders chosen by the student body.</p><p>But other members of the committee that floated the proposal weren&#8217;t as certain, and there was even open disagreement among them during the forum. Most emphasized that they wanted the forum to be a discussion, and that all details were up for debate. </p><p>And that&#8217;s something even proposal opponents can get behind. Wilson, during the forum, advocated for reforming Senate from within the current structure.  &#8220;What I would hate to see,&#8221; McCardel said, is groups checking out of the debate. He called for &#8220;a wider conversation about how ASG can be fixed in general.&#8221; As McCardel and others wrote in their <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2011/02/101270/letter-asg-should-reform-more-than-senate/">letter to North by Northwestern</a> on Wednesday, that means digging into the executive board and committees. </p><p>ASG&#8217;s fate may be at the mercy, then, of two groups: an executive board looking to reform Senate and a band of senators looking to restructure committees. The entire organization could be on the brink of revolution, or on the brink of nothing at all.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
