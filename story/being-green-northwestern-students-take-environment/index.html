Despite the one-letter difference, these two ideas aren&rsquo;t often associated on a college campus. But with about 35 percent of the Northwestern student body involved in Greek life, according to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life, sustainability manages to find its way into even the farthest corners of the quads.</p><p>Greening Greek life begins with an Eco Rep, who is appointed within each residential hall, residential college and Greek house. These students work closely with Northwestern&rsquo;s Office of Sustainability to promote eco-friendly living within their communities through information, events and initiatives.</p><p>Nearly all of the 16 Interfraternity Council (IFC) fraternities and 12 Panhellenic Association (PHA) sororities have an Eco Rep. But only about four sororities attend the weekly meetings, and fraternity representation is often slim to none, said Carrie Phillips, director of Greek Eco Reps.</p><p>&ldquo;It bothers me because we could do a lot of great things, but if people don&rsquo;t care then nothing gets done,&rdquo; said Phillips, a sophomore in Weinberg.</p><p>Engineers for a Sustainable World, a student-led group focused on sustainability projects and education, tried to increase fraternity environmental efforts last winter through their plastic waste reduction team, Pura Playa. Pura Playa works with TerraCycle, an eco-friendly company that gathers waste that is not easily recycled and converts it into products like Capri Sun pouch backpacks and circuit board picture frames. Fraternities enter this picture when TerraCycle began collecting the defining waste product of Greek life: the Solo Cup.</p><p>Pura Playa interviewed various fraternity members on their houses&rsquo; Solo Cup usage, and received estimates that ranged from 400 to 1000 cups per week. It seemed like a win-win: recycling these cups would promote Pura Playa&rsquo;s goal of reducing plastic waste, and for each cup sent in, the house would earn $0.02 that they could use towards their philanthropy of choice.</p><p>But Weinberg junior Danielle Faden, a Pura Playa co-project manager, said contacting the right people within each fraternity proved difficult. Overall, there was not a huge amount of interest.</p><p>&ldquo;We really try to reach our audience where they are and make our issue relevant to them, but I think it&rsquo;s still really difficult,&rdquo; Faden said. &ldquo;Everyone has their own priorities, and as much as I think this is an important issue that everyone should care about, not everyone is going to agree with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Ultimately, Alpha Epsilon Pi was the only fraternity that started a TerraCycling program as a direct result of Pura Playa&rsquo;s initiative. But this year, both Phi Kappa Psi and Beta Theta Pi have taken it up well.</p><p>Steve Ross, a Weinberg sophomore who implemented TerraCycling as Eco Rep for Phi Kappa Psi, said he sets up a trash can with a Solo Cup-shaped opening at parties to make it as easy as possible for people to participate.</p><p>&ldquo;The thing is if people see a trash can, they&rsquo;re gonna throw stuff in a trash can,&rdquo; Ross said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hard to be environmentally friendly in the middle of a party. We&rsquo;re not gonna collect 100 percent, but if you get 50 percent it&rsquo;s a successful night.&rdquo;</p><p>People often leave their cups lying around the house, making them easy to gather during cleanup, Ross said. As of winter quarter, Ross estimated Phi Kappa Psi had collected about 900 cups. He expects that number to keep growing.</p><p>At AEPi, over 4000 cups piled up last year, earning the fraternity about $50-$60, said Weinberg sophomore Jonathan Kamel, the AEPi Eco Rep who started TerraCycling in the house.</p><p>When it comes to sustainability in AEPi and Phi Kappa Psi, TerraCycling isn&rsquo;t flying solo. Kamel also composts his house&rsquo;s leftover food, and has helped lead AEPi to a two-year Green Cup winning streak. Ross works to reduce energy in the Phi Kappa Psi house, changing lightbulbs to fluorescents and putting in motion-sensors, as well as improving window insulation to reduce heat use.</p><p>But for other Greek houses, it&rsquo;s not easy being green. Due to lack of easy access to a recycling dumpster, Eco Rep Ben Weiss of Zeta Beta Tau said recyclables are usually just thrown away with the trash.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult thing to establish in the house and the culture,&rdquo; said Weiss, a freshman in the School of Education and Social Policy. &ldquo;Right now the convenience factor outweighs doing the right thing so much.&rdquo;</p><p>Julie Cahillane, manager of sustainability and resource management at the Office of Sustainability, said tight space in the fraternity quad prevents them from bringing in more dumpsters. However, she pointed out that the Office of Sustainability&rsquo;s website lists specific recycling pickup locations for each house.</p><p>Unlike fraternities, sorority houses have hired staff to take care of recycling. However, sustainability can still be a struggle. When Zeta Tau Alpha Eco Rep Sophie Frishberg asked her house mom to buy paper products instead of Styrofoam, she was shut down because paper is more expensive.</p><p>Despite the mixed bag of successes and frustrations, Phillips still thinks there is a lot of potential for Greek and green to resolve their differences.</p><p>&ldquo;The Greek community is really strong,&rdquo; Phillips said. &ldquo;If they regarded sustainability as an important issue, they could do really big things.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>"With 'Smart Tree,' student sustainability group plants the seed for solar power on campus" by Katherine Lee</strong></p><p>What do you do when you receive solar panels as a donation from alumni?</p><p>&ldquo;We were trying to figure out what to do with them,&rdquo; said Rachel Scholes, McCormick senior and outgoing co-president of the student group Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW), of when the group was put in that very position. &ldquo;They were just sitting in our basement, and we were like, &lsquo;We need to do something with these panels.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Scholes, who was then project manager of the ESW&rsquo;s Clean Energy Project, assembled the members for a brainstorming session.</p><p>&ldquo;I had everyone on the team draw pictures of things we could do with these solar panels,&rdquo; Scholes said. &ldquo;One person drew a tree with the leaves being solar panels.&rdquo;</p><p>Since then, the Smart Tree project has evolved, from a vague drawing of a tree to a construction plan for an 18-foot-tall aluminum structure on the south lawn of Norris Center.</p><p>The tree, powered by solar panel leaves, will have electric outlets for students to plug in their laptop and phone chargers. On days when the weather is good, students will be able to sit outside, frolicking in the sun, writing essays or procrastinating on limitless battery. An LED screen will indicate how much energy has been generated and saved in the tree&rsquo;s battery. This is the plan as of now, said Hassan Ali, McCormick sophomore and leader of the Smart Tree project.</p><p>Ali, like Scholes, is a member of the Northwestern chapter of ESW, part of a national student organization for environmental sustainability.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be part of something bigger on campus,&rdquo; said Ali, who joined the group this past fall. &ldquo;If it has a positive effect on the community, even better.&rdquo;</p><p>On the Northwestern campus, ESW is project-based and divided into sub-groups working on independent projects. Currently, there are seven different projects aimed at addressing different sustainability issues spanning from local to international, according to Scholes. The group promotes the use of clean, renewable energy on a local scale and seeks to improve access to water and food in developing countries. The Smart Tree project in particular is a subdivision of the Clean Energy Project.</p><p>According to Ali, the Smart Tree project is comprised of around twelve members. Divided into three teams, mechanical, electrical, and grant/design, the project group has spent the last year perfecting the Smart Tree&rsquo;s design, constantly testing the plan to make sure it can outlast brutal winters.</p><p>&ldquo;We designed it so the snow should just fall off,&rdquo; Ali said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our research, and solar panels during the winter don&rsquo;t get harmed. We&rsquo;ve done tests &ndash; wind, snow, rain. It should be okay. We&rsquo;re taking precautions.&rdquo;</p><p>Though not many students know of the project, building an 18-foot structure with an estimated cost of $18,000 is no small matter. According to Ali, the Tree received grants from Boeing and the Northwestern Sustainability Fund. The project is also collaborating with the Office of Sustainability and Students for Ecological and Environmental Development (SEED).</p><p>Both collaborators saw the benefits of building a solar tree outside a building bustling with student activity.</p><p>&ldquo;It needs to be safe, and it needs to be something that works with the campus aesthetic,&rdquo; said Rob Whittier, Northwestern&rsquo;s Director of Sustainability. He has been working with student organizations, helping them navigate their way around the different stakeholders in the university environment.</p><p>Though he said the Smart Tree would be a &ldquo;great visual display&rdquo; because of its interactive setting, Whittier admitted that the Tree, on strictly economic terms, would not save the university or the students a lot of money, describing it as &ldquo;more of an education about solar power.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ninety-nine percent of people don&rsquo;t know that we have a solar [array] up there,&rdquo; Whittier said about the solar panels installed on top of the Ford Design building. &ldquo;The solar [array] up there is big enough, it&rsquo;s 17 killowatts. It powers one of the computer labs in Tech.&rdquo;</p><p>Whittier said he expects the Smart Tree to shed light on the various eco-friendly ways that are already present on campus.</p><p>&ldquo;The solar tree, because of its location, will be highly visible to students and guests on campus,&rdquo; said Whittier. &ldquo;One of the things I&rsquo;ve asked is that the solar tree have some communication about the fact that there is another solar [array] up there. So to me, the solar tree is about being a visible display that Northwestern is doing something around solar energy.&rdquo;</p><p>For several years, SEED had been trying to build an eco-friendly bottle-brick bench, with &ldquo;bricks&rdquo; from plastic bottles stuffed with non-recyclable plastic bags and wrappers, then covered in a concoction of water and clay. It is part of a bigger environmental movement called Peace On Earthbench, which encourages the creative reuse of waste by &nbsp;sharing instructions and anecdotes on the benches.</p><p>SEED has already held bottle-bricking workshops to reach out to students, but the first such bench at Northwestern will be installed next year, under the Smart Tree on the Norris lawn.</p><p>&ldquo;ESW was looking for a customized bench that is eco-friendly, made out of recycled materials, that can be shaped around their Smart Tree Project,&rdquo; Roshanne Malekmadani, McCormick freshman and SEED Executive Board Member, said. The plan was perfect. SEED had the bench, and ESW had the location and the shade.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great way to repurpose waste,&rdquo; Malekmadani said. &ldquo;It encourages people to reduce the amount of waste they produce in their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>Malekmadani had already built a bottle-brick bench in high school when she joined SEED and learned that students at Northwestern were also trying to do the same thing.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all working towards a common cause,&rdquo; Malekmadani said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a few meetings to discuss collaborating and the timeline of the project. It seems like it&rsquo;s beneficial for both groups.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>"Grad student paints the town green" by Miranda Cawley</strong></p><p>The Chicago skyline is already iconic. The Willis Tower stands tall above a tapestry of skyscrapers, punctuated by the Aon Center and Two Prudential Plaza and capped off by Lake Point Tower at the very end. But sometime soon, these buildings might become even more unique: They will be topped in green.</p><p>That&rsquo;s Kelly Kzariak&rsquo;s hope, anyway. A PhD candidate in the Plant Biology and Conservation program at Northwestern, Kzariak is determining whether or not our sprawling city could become a new home for the prairies that human settlement has replaced.</p><p>Instead of spending her time in greenhouses, Kzariak conducts her research on the rooftops of Chicago. There, she studies the fitness and reproductive rates of prairie plants, of which less than a tenth of one percent still exist in Illinois. Her project, if implemented on a large scale, could contribute to the continued survival of many endangered native plants.</p><p>For Kzariak, the use of rooftop gardens for conservation seemed like a natural progression.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed nature and being outside, but I also enjoy the energy and excitement of the city,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I heard about green roofs, I thought voila &ndash; this is perfect! The plants are losing habitat but might gain new habitat in cities.&rdquo;</p><p>Kzariak grew up in Chicago, and taught biology at New Trier High School in the North Shore for three years before discovering a passion for plant and conservation biology after teaching it in the classroom. She has since completed her Masters in the Plant Biology and Conservation program at Northwestern.</p><p>However, her journey hasn&rsquo;t all been smooth sailing. The unique conditions of a rooftop garden pose a challenge for many native prairie species. Rooftops necessarily only have a shallow layer of soil, which holds less rain and gives less space for deep root systems. They also tend to experience more sun and warmer temperatures thanks to their location.</p><p>For this reason Kzariak focuses her research on plants from short grass prairies, which include grasses and flowers that only grow to knee-height as opposed to long grass prairies, which tower above her head.</p><p>&ldquo;Not all prairie plants can grow on green roofs. I found that there are some that can,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometimes the species can adapt to what ends up being stressful environmental conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>Plants are grown in soil, but underneath is a synthetic soil-like substance that traps water for plant use. Whatever water escapes the soil mixture is funneled into drainage channels. This way, the storm water that isn&rsquo;t absorbed by the plants and soil mixture is filtered by it, allowing for cleaner run off.</p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of roofs to experiment on: the green roof movement is well established in Chicago. Right now, the city has the most green roofs of anywhere in the country &ndash; almost 7 million square feet of green roofs in 2010, according to Yale University's <em>Environment 360</em>&nbsp;&ndash; &nbsp;thanks in part to an early 2000s program where Chicagoans got tax breaks for installing them.</p><p>According to Paul Erlichman, Membership Coordinator for the North American green roof industry association Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, the trend is also exploding around North America.</p><p>&ldquo;Green roofs were a very small, niche technology up until 10 or 15 years ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen double digit growth rate every year since 2003.&rdquo;</p><p>Sod roofs have existed for centuries in Scandinavia and other areas in northern Europe, but the modern trend didn&rsquo;t begin until the 1970&rsquo;s in Germany. The basic technology developed then is still used today.</p><p>Erlichman pointed out that conservation is one of the many environmental benefits of the green roof movement. In addition to managing stormwater, they provide an extra layer of insulation, which reduces the energy needed both to heat and cool the building.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if the green roof isn&rsquo;t being studied for its biodiversity or its fauna life that it supports, just having that green space in the city is going to be beneficial to biodiversity,&rdquo; he said.</p>--></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story-900"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
