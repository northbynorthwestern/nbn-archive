This is despite the fact that <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/30/paul-manafort-indictment-foreign-lobbying-russia-probe-215764" target="_blank">very few people actually register</a> with the government for their foreign lobbying. FARA&rsquo;s office has a limited budget and little legal ability to enforce the sanctions it does impose on lobbying groups for violating rules ‒ fines, for example ‒ and before now, there were <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/30/manafort-lobbyists-wakeup-call-215763" target="_blank">few people</a> in Washington succeeding in doing anything about it.</p><p>Manafort, despite <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-manafort-offers-12-million-in-assets-to-avoid-house-arrest/" target="_blank">offering $12 million</a> to get out of it, is on house arrest, along with his longtime adviser, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/30/politics/manafort-gates-put-under-house-arrest/index.html" target="_blank">Rick Gates</a>.

Mueller (who began leading the Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/jeff-sessions-russia-trump-investigation-democrats.html" target="_blank">recused</a> himself from subject in March) has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-mueller-trump-russia-probe-20170920-story.html" target="_blank">established</a> that he plans to take wide aim with this investigation, hence the charges against Manafort that go back years into his &ldquo;<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/10/30/paul-manafort-indictment-foreign-lobbying-russia-probe-215764" target="_blank">sleazy</a>&rdquo; career.</p><p>Manfort, among other things, has a record of <a href="https://cloudfront-files-1.publicintegrity.org/legacy_projects/pdf_reports/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf" target="_blank">promoting regimes with human rights violations</a>, being involved with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-04-13/trump-just-hired-his-next-scandal-lobbyist-paul-manafort" target="_blank">influence-peddling scandals</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-04-13/trump-just-hired-his-next-scandal-lobbyist-paul-manafort" target="_blank">working with presidents</a> who were ousted from power by their own people. In 2016, right after President Trump promoted Manafort to campaign manager, a Bloomberg opinion piece somewhat omnisciently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-04-13/trump-just-hired-his-next-scandal-lobbyist-paul-manafort" target="_blank">wrote</a> that, &ldquo;Trump Just Hired His Next Scandal.&rdquo;</p><p>Manafort <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/us/politics/paul-manafort-resigns-donald-trump.html?_r=0" target="_blank">resigned</a> from the Trump campaign in August of 2016. His relationship with Trump soured, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/15/us/politics/paul-manafort-ukraine-donald-trump.html" target="_blank">reports</a> about his activities in Ukraine were surfacing, and it likely did not bode well for a candidate who was already <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/donald-trump-2016-russia-today-rt-kremlin-media-vladimir-putin-213833" target="_blank">being criticized for his relationship with Putin</a> to have a campaign chairman with connections to a pro-Russian disgraced former president of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>How we got here: Trump&rsquo;s presidency edition</strong></p><p>The FBI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/us/politics/paul-manafort-home-search-mueller.html" target="_blank">raided</a> Manafort's home in July, and the special counsel told him to expect an indictment months ago.</p><p>Nevertheless, the indictment on Monday shocked many in Washington. Then, hours after the arrest, Mueller released documents showing that a former Trump campaign advisor, George Papadopoulos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?_r=0" target="_blank">pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI</a> about meetings with Russians and cooperated with the Mueller&rsquo;s investigation for months by providing testimony about the campaign.</p><p>Specifically, Papadopoulos <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/special-counsel-indictments.html" target="_blank">lied</a> to investigators about a meeting with a Russian agent who assured the campaign officials &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; on then-candidate Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?_r=0" target="_blank">wrote</a>, &ldquo;It is now clear, from Mr. Papadopoulos&rsquo;s admission and emails related to a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016, that the Russian government offered help to Mr. Trump&rsquo;s candidacy and campaign officials were willing to take it.&rdquo;</p><p>Another former campaign official downgraded the credibility of Papadopoulos&rsquo;s confession, saying that the foreign policy advisor was no more than &ldquo;<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/357948-former-trump-campaign-adviser-papadopoulos-was-coffee-boy" target="_blank">the coffee boy.</a>&rdquo;</p><p>President Trump has denied collusion with Russia since the investigation's inception.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!</p>
