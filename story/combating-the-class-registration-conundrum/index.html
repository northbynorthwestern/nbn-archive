When I select my classes, I almost do so with a map of the campus in mind. Of course, I'm all for picking classes that I like, but when it comes down to the margin, location is the factor that sets classes apart.</p><p>I have to say, my virtual mapping pays off. I've never had to double back on campus because my classes were on opposite ends, sit in Kresge for more than an hour a week or take a shuttle because it was physically impossible to make it to class on time. My back-to-back classes were always in close proximity so I could get from one to the other with enough time to get settled.&nbsp;</p><p>Location is inextricably linked with weather in my decision making process. This winter quarter, I made sure my farthest class was three minutes away from my dorm to maximize my time beneath the covers and minimize my time in the Polar Vortex. On the other hand, I planned to take Annenberg classes in the fall and spring so I could study on the banks of the pond between classes.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also several, less practical concerns that influence the classes I pick in regards to location. I'm particularly fond of the Owen Leverone Coon Forum at Kellogg but try to avoid classes in Kresge because no weather application or meteorologist could give me an accurate reading of the temperatures there.&nbsp;</p><p>The most impractical factor I work around in my scheduling is my small (not-so-small) thing against Tech. I avoid classes in Tech like the plague in order to preserve my best "Never have I ever" because most of my friends are engineers, science majors or Mudd-dwellers and &nbsp;"I have never had a class at Tech" gets them every time.</p><p>I've become unhealthily dedicated to maintaining this "Never I have ever". To achieve this, I've ever picked a discussion section in Francis Searle over one in Tech despite the extra walk and am holding out for my statistics class to move to South Campus before I take it.&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>Three quick shopping tips</p><p>by Seth Kelley</p><p>Shopping for classes is like shopping for groceries. "There are so many options!" you think when you walk through the doors. "That salisbury steak has so much potential, and could that be an avocado I see out of the corner of my eye?" But reality is bleak, and you inevitably leave the store clutching onto three varieties of pasta sauce and seven boxes of Hot Pockets. Because let's face it &ndash; grocery shopping is complicated, steak means time and effort and an avocado costs approximately $16.</p><p>Thankfully there is good news about registering for class. Please don't ask me about groceries. If CAESAR is the grocery store, CTECs are like coupon books, helping you make the best shopping decisions. God knows we can use as much help as we can get, so if you've managed to navigate CAESAR well enough to select classes, it's worth the extra minute or two to check out the reviews.</p><p>When you go to register for classes this week, the best place to start is the very bottom where previous students pack as many superlatives as possible into a sentence or two describing the class overall. It's usually a convoluted and overwhelming mess of reactions, so here are some things to look out for when you read your next CTEC.</p><p>1. Always read the all-caps comments first.&nbsp;</p><p>When someone comments on a CTEC in all caps, there's a chance they've completely lost it, but it's probably also worth heed their passion. These all-caps comments can be divided into two camps &ndash; THIS IS THE WORST CLASS EVER, and THIS IS AN EASY A. I can't personally attest to whether the first type of comment tends to be true because, well, I've never registered for a class with such a warning, but the other kind, the easy A kind, tend to be pretty reliable. We're all nerds (in the best way, of course), and we all like a challenge, but if you're looking for a fourth class you can breeze through, it's worth sifting through CAESAR in order to find an all-caps easy A class.</p><p>2. Be cautious of words like "interesting" and phrases like "learned a lot."</p><p>Considering the nerdiness of your peers, these tip-offs can be a trap. If you're considering registering for that Poli Sci class and students are saying that a course was "really interesting," you might be prone to think you too will find this class fascinating. That's when you realize this is probably a student who knows how Ted Cruz voted in the past eight elections and probably knows something about Rob Ford besides his crack habits and uncanny resemblance to Chris Farley. Beware of the liberal use of "learned a lot" in CTECs as it probably translates to "I was the only one in this class who had a remote interest in knowing more about this topic." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3. Pay special attention if the words "plays favorites" get tossed around.</p><p>This one is tricky because it can work in your favor or against you just as easily. We've all taken classes where the professor plays favorites. And if you don't think you have, then by the official rules of playing favorites in class, whether you realize it or not you are probably that kid. But don't worry, because now you know. And now when you go to pick your classes, you know to zero in on those two little words. But if you tend to find yourself on the outside, beware. Taking a class with a teacher who plays favorites can not only hurt your grade, but also spoil your love for a topic you might care about otherwise.</p><p>Stop making the same mistakes I made before I learned how to read CTECs. Fall quarter of my freshman year I registered for "Introduction to Macroeconomics." That was before I learned how to read CTECs. I often think back and wonder how my life would be different if someone had just showed me how to read CTECs. It is truly the best and only way to make sure you end up in the best classes. Do yourself a favor, scroll down to the bottom of the class review and follow these simple tips. Your sanity and your transcript will thank you.</p><p></p><p>There's more to classes than scheduling</p><p>by Jacob Jones</p><p>I hear people complain all the time about their distribution requirements. People seem to complain a lot about requirements that are actually extremely flexible. I try to take advantage of the flexibility of the requirements to give myself the most diverse possible set of classes I can take.</p><p>My first quarter on campus I had one class that was mostly problem sets, one that was reading, one writing and one language. The variety of the work made it so that if I got bored with one type of work, I could easily switch to something completely different. Why should I drudge through a course schedule of labs, problem sets and even more problem sets, when I could learn about matrices, Dostoevsky and Slobodan Milo&scaron;ević all at the same time?</p><p>My second quarter, it didn't work out quite as nicely. After four classes that I wanted closed, I ended up in two heavily reading and writing based classes. It wasn't horrible, but I felt a lot more bogged down in all the work I had to do, because it was so much of the same.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, coming to the end of my first year, I realize that there are a multitude of options. At other schools, general education requirements are often very limited, very basic and very boring. Where other schools might let you choose between <a href="http://www.registrar.fas.harvard.edu/courses-exams/courses-instruction/ethical-reasoning">a few dozen classes</a> for their requirements, our distribution requirements often have <a href="http://www.weinberg.northwestern.edu/handbook/documents/Area_V_2013-14.pdf">over a hundred</a> options to choose from. With that many possible classes, there's always a way to make sure that your schedule is as diverse as possible.</p><p>The reason why most people don't have diverse schedules is the logistics. There's that extremely interesting sounding class you want to take, but it's at 9 a.m. Or maybe it's at Tech and you live in Willard. Or maybe the CTECs are a little bit under what you normally consider for your classes. So you choose the less interesting class that's next door at 11 a.m. Halfway through the quarter you're bored out of your mind, deciding whether or not you should even show up to class, when in the other class you would have been back from class already, with work that will keep you interested, instead of even more problem sets.</p><p>Registration is coming up, and there are always difficult choices to be made. Sometimes the distro you want fills up, or conflicts with a class you need to graduate, but there's a trick. You have four years to take the classes you want to take. You don't have to finish them in two years. If the one you want fills up this year, wait until next year when your registration time is days earlier than it was this year. Don't settle for a distro you don't want to take, unless it's a necessity, because really, why take a class you don't like and don't need? Obviously some majors and tracks &ndash; yes, that means you premeds &ndash; are stuck with prescribed schedules with little flexibility, but overall, you're in charge.</p><p>Whatever way you choose your classes, try to think through the big picture. Yes, the timing is important, and yes, walking all the way across the less than one-mile campus is a burden. However, think about how much you'll like the other class, and how much more diverse the work will be, even if it isn't the most rational choice in your schedule. There's more to class picking than efficiency.</p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Listen to your heart, when classes call to you</p><p class="MsoNormal">By Orko Manna</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ahhh, class registration. It comes during the middle of each quarter and reminds us all that our suffering will be prolonged for another three months. But regardless of the fact that the quarter system induces constant tears and excruciating pain, there is something mysteriously magical about class registration. And after finally navigating the <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3e1zfTrIA1qbdycho1_500.gif" target="_blank">labyrinth</a> of CAESAR to find your registration time, you actually have to start thinking about what classes to take.</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I need to take [insert scary science class here], so I can be a quarter ahead."</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I want to double count this class. I won't like it, but whatever."</p><p class="MsoNormal">"I literally hate my class schedule."</p><p class="MsoNormal">I hear people say these things all too often. Shouldn't we take classes that are fun and enjoyable, especially because we pick them ourselves? The answer is "yes" in theory; but as Northwestern students, we tend to listen to our brains &ndash; not our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9U65tEwc8o" target="_blank">hearts</a>. We should pick classes based on our interests and what classes will make our schedule more fun. Sure, we need certain courses for requirements, but sometimes we just need to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/B9ItxI5.gif" target="_blank">let it go</a>.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Picking classes that actually interest us will make us more engaged with our academics. I can't even count how many times someone has told me they don't care about a reading or an assignment &ndash; and I've been there myself too. Why do we bother taking classes that make us feel like we're running on a <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/TMbvr.gif" target="_blank">never-ending treadmill</a>? Let's pick classes that seem interesting, instead of boring ones that will double count or get us ahead. Who knows, we might start cracking smiles in Tech. It can be hard to focus when you're forcing yourself to sit through a boring lecture. As energetic and hyperactive youths, we learn best through engagement. And the best way to actually care about your classes is to pick ones that make us smile. Cute, right?</p><p class="MsoNormal">In a similar vein, picking classes we like will give us a breather from the hectic world that is Northwestern. We #gocats on Saturdays and we party hard every so often, but we also stress out too much. We get frustrated when that one class doesn't double count, and we throw temper tantrums when a prerequisite for our sixth major gets filled up. <a href="http://cf.foreveryoungadult.com/_uploads/images/sassygay_lookatyourlife.gif" target="_blank">Wait, what?</a> We just need to take a step back and think about what we really want to get out of our class schedules. We are so stressed planning out our whole lives, that we forget to stop and actually enjoy a big part of our college experience &ndash; the classes we take. Enjoy college and try to stop worrying so much about the terrors of adulthood. Afterall, YOCO.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Most importantly, creating a class schedule that lets us explore our true interests will make us happier. Let's take advantage of the academic opportunities Northwestern gives us to become happier wildkittens. If reading classic novels in a British accent brings you joy, take "19th Century British Literature." If you're into getting hot and bothered across the pond, take "Sex and Scandal in Early Modern England." There is surely a class that floats your boat, whatever your interests are. And when you find that perfect match, you'll be as happy as Pharrell's hat.</p><p class="MsoNormal">So there you have it. Forget your major. Forget your minor. (Okay, don't actually forget those things. You probably need to graduate with some sort of degree.) As registration approaches us, think about the things that actually make you happy. My challenge to you: Take at least one class that you choose purely out of interest. You'll be singing "Joy to the World" so often that not even a polar vortex can bring you down.</p>--><div class="caption">Production by Luis Sanchez / North by Northwestern</div></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
