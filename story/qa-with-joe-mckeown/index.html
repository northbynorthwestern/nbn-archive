Head coach Joe McKeown opens up about Coffey, the team and coaching a Wildcat team that doesn't include his daughter.</p><p><strong>First of all, how&rsquo;s the team looking this year? </strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s exciting. I think it&rsquo;s like spring training. Everybody&rsquo;s 0-0 going into the season. We just had Big Ten meetings, media day. We just feel like we&rsquo;re ready to get going. With five starters back and two starters from the year before that, we have seven that have played a lot of basketball here, and it&rsquo;s going to be fun.</p><p><strong>Were you happy with the way that last year ended, with the NIT appearance? </strong></p><p>Yeah, you wish you had a couple minutes back here and there, but they were great games, great experiences for our players. To be in a one and done tournament where you get beat and your season&rsquo;s over, it&rsquo;s good for them to experience that. And with everybody coming back, hopefully we&rsquo;ll give them something to build off of.</p><p><strong>Last year, you had a pretty young team. How have some of the freshmen from last year stepped up this year, both in terms of leadership and stepping up their game in general?</strong></p><p>I think they&rsquo;ve worked really hard over the summer. That was a big thing. We have a saying, April to October, great players are made. And November to March, great teams are made. They really worked on their game individually. They really took that to heart.</p><p><strong>Has anyone in particular so far, while y&rsquo;all have been practicing, really stood out to you?</strong></p><p>I think everybody&rsquo;s doing what they should do. Everybody has come back better than they were at the end of last year. We&rsquo;re integrating three freshmen. I think everybody is doing what they should be doing, they&rsquo;re at where I expected them to be at this point. Some days, Nia [Coffey] will do some things that will stand out, other days it will be Maggie Lyon or Lauren Douglas. It&rsquo;s been good. We have some depth.</p><p><strong> Is it weird to not have [your daughter] Meghan on the team anymore?</strong></p><p>Yeah, it is weird. Surreal. It was one of those incredible experiences as a coach that not many people get to do. For her, too, there were probably some hard times that she had to deal with having her father as the coach, but I was really proud of the way she handled it. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for the world. She&rsquo;s doing really well in the sports journalism field, so I&rsquo;m happy for her.</p><p><strong>What do you consider this year to be a successful season?</strong></p><p>I think sometimes, other people&rsquo;s version of success can be different. When you&rsquo;re in the locker room every day with your team, and you&rsquo;re on the court with them every day, my definition of success is &ldquo;Did we play together, stay together.&rdquo; Sometimes, there are things you can&rsquo;t control. Some of the best teams, the most fun teams I&rsquo;ve ever coached maybe didn&rsquo;t play in the NCAA tournament or get to the Sweet 16, like some of the other teams I&rsquo;ve coached. I enjoyed the first team moreso, maybe, because of different personalities. And, staying healthy would make it successful. We had some injuries the last couple years that I think held us back a little bit. But like any team, that&rsquo;s part of basketball. I think for us, a successful season would just be to play hard and to enjoy playing together, be fun to watch. Just play with a purpose.</p><p><strong>Nia Coffey was first team All-Big Ten last year. Did you expect that level of production from her as a freshman?</strong></p><p>There were a couple of days last October where I was like, &ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo; She can do some things that no one else in the gym can do. I saw some bits and pieces. Then, as we got into games into November and December, I saw a competitiveness that you don&rsquo;t know until you get into some of these situations. I saw that she was humble, unselfish, and just wanted to win. That really stood out in my mind. I think it carried over when she was named first-team All-Conference as a freshman, which has never happened here before. She handled it. Some freshmen might let it go to their head. She handled it as well as anybody I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time.</p><p><strong>What do you think is the identity of this team?</strong></p><p>As it plays itself out, I think the identity will be just a really unselfish team. We have a lot of players that have had a lot of accolades in their careers, whether that be high school, different national teams in different countries, like Karly Roser. All-Big Ten, All-Conference, Maggie Lyon was Big Ten freshman of the year. For them to be able to be unselfish and put their team above the individual part, I think that will hopefully be the identity of this group.</p><p><strong>Are we going to make the NCAA tournament this year?</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m not on the committee. If I were, I&rsquo;d put us in. I think all those things will play themselves out. You&rsquo;ve got to put yourself in position in the non-conference by scheduling correctly. In the conference, we just added Rutgers and Maryland, one a final four team and one played for the national championship a couple years ago, so you&rsquo;re talking about elite women&rsquo;s basketball programs that are coming in. That&rsquo;ll do two things. That&rsquo;ll make it more competitive and that will also hopefully give the committee more teams in the Big Ten to look at. They&rsquo;re the last two games of the year for us.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
