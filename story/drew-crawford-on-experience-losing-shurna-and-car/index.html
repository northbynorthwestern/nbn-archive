He walks off the court with the swagger of a player that creates his own offense, but flashes the charismatic smile that&rsquo;s won over Northwestern fans for three years now.</p><p>A preseason candidate for the Senior CLASS Award for outstanding Division I student athletes, there are high expectations for the Naperville, Ill. native. Crawford averaged more than 16 points per game in 2011-12, and with the Wildcats vying for their first NCAA Tournament berth, his role on the team figures to increase tenfold this winter.</p><p>After a single-game career high of 35 points and a 3-point percentage of .412 last year, there&rsquo;s no denying Crawford&rsquo;s star power along the perimeter. But as the season rolls in, North by Northwestern caught up with Crawford to talk about senior leadership, personnel adjustments and offseason changes.</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;re the clear-cut leader of this team, being the most experienced and most credentialed player on the roster. How have you seen yourself step into that role so far?</strong></p><p>I think it&rsquo;s big that the guys with experience really be the leaders of the team, that&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really important to us. Especially with a lot of young guys this year, what it comes down to is working hard, leading by example and setting a good example for these guys. It&rsquo;s about being ready to practice every day, working hard in the weight room and making sure the others work hard as well. A lot of times other players will follow your good example.</p><p><strong>Northwestern lost all-time program scoring leader John Shurna this spring. How has the team transitioned without him so far, and what are you doing to prepare for your new role in this offense?</strong></p><p>I think it&rsquo;s a much different team than the one we had from last year. We lost quite a few guys, and we have a lot of new guys coming in. We&rsquo;re just kind of moving on, sharing that scoring that we&rsquo;re losing with Johnny. It&rsquo;s a shared responsibility for all of us. We have to play better this year and really pick it up without him.</p><p><strong>Without Shurna, and with some of the new big bodies the Wildcats have added, is this still a perimeter offense? Do you see a balance or shift in philosophy here?</strong></p><p>No, it&rsquo;s pretty much the same; the offense we run always stays the same. We believe in this offense, and when we run it hard, it works. We&rsquo;ve always had personnel that&rsquo;s very versatile. Our centers are versatile, as are our forwards and guards. We&rsquo;re really able to do a lot with our offense.</p><p><strong>If that&rsquo;s the case, how do you see these new recruits influencing the team? Where do you see them making an impact?</strong></p><p>They&rsquo;re stepping in and playing hard. A lot of these kids are playing hard, and I know that when they get into the game, they&rsquo;ll be moving at 100 miles an hour, making an impact, and I think that&rsquo;s going to be great. They&rsquo;re going to add a little bit of depth too because a lot of them are talented enough and know enough to be able to play right away. That&rsquo;s going to help us out big time.</p><p><strong>Last year, you were honored as an Academic All-American and a Third Team All-Big Ten player. What does this balance mean to you as you head into your senior year?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s a blessing being awarded accolades like that. The way I look at it is that with team success comes individual success. So, whatever we&rsquo;re able to do as a team, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going to be really important to me. When the team is playing well, each individual is playing well. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s important to us and we really just want to have a great year as a team.</p><p><strong>Last year, you saw career highs in points per game, floor shooting percentage and 3-point shooting percentage. How do you see yourself being able to improve for another season?</strong></p><p>I think scoring off the dribble was one thing that was really important to me when working this summer. Being able to create my own shot, that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been working on a lot, especially the end-of-the-clock situations when things are breaking down and I can make a play. I worked in scoring on the post too, and overall strength. Strength, quickness and things like that are important for defensive rebounding, so those were really important to me over the summer.</p><p><strong>You&rsquo;ve shown an ability to take over games, with a career-high of 35 points in a game. Are there certain nights where you just want to take control? &nbsp;Do you have that sort of mindset going in to the season? Or are you looking to see bigger roles from returning players like point guard Dave Sobolewski or forward Reggie Hearn?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s a balance of both. There are some games where you&rsquo;re feeling it, and you just want to take over, and then there are games where somebody else is thinking like that. Of course, in a lot of games it&rsquo;s a shared thing. Our offense gives a lot of looks to everybody, so a lot of times it&rsquo;s just whoever&rsquo;s hot is knocking down shots. Our offense moves to find the open guy.</p><p><strong>Scouting out the rest of the Big Ten this year, is there any team that you&rsquo;re particularly excited to play? Maybe nervous?</strong></p><p>No, I don&rsquo;t think so. There&rsquo;s no team in particular that I&rsquo;m really excited to play. Obviously, it&rsquo;s going to be tough this year; the Big Ten is real competitive. I think we&rsquo;re just excited for the season in general. We&rsquo;re excited for the season to start and for Big Ten play too.</p><p><strong>As the season approaches, Northwestern fans are forced to remember the team&rsquo;s inability to finish down the stretch last year. What preventive measures are you taking to ensure that the Wildcats end strong this time?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s just about staying composed, making sure we keep our heads and keep our intensity at the end of games. I think it&rsquo;s important to even up it, because the end of the game and the end of the season is when you have to be your toughest. That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s big for us, really picking up the intensity and staying strong in the last few moments.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
