Mark then punched the ball in from three yards to give Northwestern a 7-0 lead.</p><p>It was the first of five drives that resulted in running touchdowns, the most for the Wildcats in over three years.</p><p>The balance of Colter and Trevor Siemian as quarterbacks 1A and 1B continued to thrive, even though the duo was rarely needed to use their right arms. Colter went 7-for-9 for 46 yards, while Siemian went 4-for-5 for 72.</p><p>The Wildcats got a pair of scares in the first quarter when Colter and Siemian each appeared to get banged up on different hits.</p><p>Colter came out during the team&rsquo;s second drive after getting hit on a first down scramble and aggravating a left wrist injury he sustained against Syracuse three weeks ago. On the following drive, Siemian appeared to hurt his left wrist after getting hit by a blitzing safety as he released the ball. However, both quarterbacks returned and should be on track to play next week against Indiana.</p><p>The Wildcats flaunted their depth at running back on Saturday as Mark, Tyris Jones, Mike Trumpy and Treyvon Green all saw significant action.</p><p>Mark continued to excel as Northwestern&rsquo;s primary ball carrier. He carried the ball only 16 times but picked up 117 yards and scored three touchdowns.</p><p>Trumpy, last week&rsquo;s hero, dressed for the game but did not see action until the second half. Fitzgerald later said that was a precautionary measure after Trumpy got banged up during his 106-yard effort against Boston College.</p><p>&ldquo;We wanted to keep their touches under 25,&rdquo; Fitzgerald said of both Mark and Trumpy. &ldquo;To get both of those guys quite a bit of rest was kind of the plan, and I guess mission accomplished.&rdquo;</p><p>The defense stepped up once again. They allowed 51 yards on the ground, good for only 2.2 yards per carry and forced punts on six of South Dakota&rsquo;s 10 drives. After a disastrous opening game against Syracuse, the defense has become the team&rsquo;s rock, holding their last three opponents to an average of 11 points.</p><p>But even after the team&rsquo;s most complete performance of the season and a spotless record, the undefeated Wildcats are maintaining their focus as they prepare to enter Big Ten season.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a clean slate we have now,&rdquo; said defensive end Quentin Williams, who had four tackles, a sack and two pass breakups against South Dakota. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously gratifying to be 4-0&hellip;but we have a long way to go.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Three things we learned</strong></p><p><strong>1. Patience is no longer Fitz&rsquo;s middle name</strong></p><p>Head coach Pat Fitzgerald has said publically that he may have been too loyal to some of players last season as they stumbled to an embarrassing 2-5 start. He has been sure not to repeat the same mistake in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Demetrius Dugar, the much-maligned cornerback who struggled each week, lost his starting job on Saturday to Stanford-transfer Quinn Evans. Although the move may have come too slow for some fans, it is now part of a trend for Fitzgerald this season.</p><p>Neal Deiters returned from injury to start at right guard, replacing senior Chuck Porcelli. Fitzgerald has also benched starting safety Davion Fleming for Jared Carpenter after their opener at Syracuse.</p><p>Fitzgerald was hesitant to publically criticize the performance of either player he benched this week but his message on performing well during practice was crystal clear.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Both [Dugar] and Chuck [Porcelli] are doing great but they&rsquo;re in a competitive situation right now and every rep counts. Every rep counts,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>2. It is still Venric Mark&rsquo;s backfield</strong></p><p>After only mustering three field goals on four attempts in the redzone last week, the Wildcats made a statement by repeatedly punching the ball into the endzone. They scored four touchdowns on five tries inside the endzone and booted in a field goal on their other try.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We ran the ball more efficiently and we were able to control the line of scrimmage," Fitzgerald said. &ldquo;Obviously, if you can run the ball down there it makes things a lot easier.... A week ago, it wasn&rsquo;t anything magical. We just weren&rsquo;t executing in the moment."&nbsp;</p><p>Mark executed more than anyone else in the moment, as each of his three touchdowns came inside the redzone. After getting knocked out of last week&rsquo;s game against Boston College with a lower body injury, questions bubbled up about his durability and role as the team&rsquo;s No. 1 running back. Trumpy&rsquo;s performance certainly added to that.</p><p>But after Saturday, Mark is averaging only 18 carries per game but already has 399 yards on the ground. That is good for over 5.5 yards per carry.</p><p>He is only 72 yards away from passing the total rushing yards by Northwestern&rsquo;s leading running back last season and is on pace to become Northwestern&rsquo;s first 1,000-yard rusher since 2006.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. The Big Ten is seriously wide open</strong></p><p>As Steven Goldstein <a href="../b1g-recap/index.html">wrote</a> earlier in the week, the Big Ten has looked truly awful this season. And it only got worse on Saturday.&nbsp;</p><p>Iowa dropped a stunner at home to Central Michigan, 32-31 on a last second field goal. They are now 2-2 and realistically could have been 1-3, escaping with a one-point win against Northern Illinois in their first game.</p><p>Michigan State trailed winless Eastern Michigan at home for almost three quarters before pulling out a 23-7 win. Wisconsin also struggled to put away UTEP in Madison and Ohio State had their own problems with UAB. It was another ugly day.</p><p>The truth is that we did not learn a lot about the Wildcats this week. South Dakota racked up 67 yards of penalties, dropped catchable passes and was generally sloppy in every phase of the game.</p><p>But this conference continues to look weaker than ever and should have the 4-0 Wildcats beginning to think, &ldquo;Why not us?&rdquo; as Big Ten champions.</p><p>The Wildcats have been far from perfect in their first four games but in this year more than any other, it will not take perfection to earn a Rose Bowl berth.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
