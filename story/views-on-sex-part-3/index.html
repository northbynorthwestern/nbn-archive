Find the first&nbsp;<a href="../views-on-sex/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and the second <a href="../views-on-sex-part-2/index.html">here</a>.</div><p>This woman, an anonymous Northwestern senior who had never engaged in any sexual relationships before college, used to have a monogamous mentality on love and sex. But after having a pretty dry first quarter, she had her first time with her first crush from seventh grade. After engaging in a longterm relationship, she realized that systemic relationships are inevitable and that people should be able to share their love with multiple people. &nbsp;</p><p><em>On first love:</em></p><p>My first major crush was in seventh grade. He was a year older than me and went to my middle school. He was that mysterious skateboarder. The guy I always wanted to know more about. It was basically like the goal that I knew I would never attain &ndash; until we actually started hanging out via mutual friends. After getting to know him more, I wasn&rsquo;t as infatuated anymore. That initial honeymoon energy went down and I wasn&rsquo;t really so romantically attracted to him because I saw him for what he was and not for the ideal that was in my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t have actual sex until winter break my freshman year when I was home in Virginia. It was actually the guy I had a crush on in seventh grade. He had always told me he&rsquo;d be the one to take it and I knew he would, too. I was just so comfortable with him.&nbsp;</p><p><em>On uncomplicated sex:</em></p><div class="sidebar">I have infinite amounts of love. I can have sexual and romantic relationships with multiple people at once.</div><p>I&rsquo;d always believed that sex was complicated. I knew I didn&rsquo;t have sexual love for everyone and that I couldn&rsquo;t give sexual love to more than one person. I had this traditional monogamous conceptualization of love and sex, so I was looking for the right person to give all of my sexual energy to &ndash; but what I&rsquo;ve been realizing over the years is that I have infinite amounts of love. I can have sexual and romantic relationships with multiple people at once.</p><p><em>On casual sex:</em></p><p>I don&rsquo;t think sex is casual. I think it can be casual if you intentionally create it in that way and you discuss that casualness with your partner. I believe you should explicitly say, &ldquo;Hey, I'm looking for a purely physical fulfillment. I'm not looking for an emotional fulfillment."</p><p>I think that reflects more about the person than the actual sex act itself. I would encourage asking that person why they want physical and not just emotional relationships, because I think that sex is always emotional. It&rsquo;s our relationship to our bodies. It&rsquo;s our relationship to other people&rsquo;s bodies. It&rsquo;s about self-love, self-care. I think it&rsquo;s very emotional, so when people dismiss that element, I question their history, and I question their own relationship to their body.</p><p><em>On college hookup culture:</em></p><div class="sidebar">I feel like there was a lack of intention in the sex community here &hellip; It just happens and no one will reflect on it. We reflect on it with all of our friends, but we don&rsquo;t actually talk to the actual sexual partner who we have had sex with.</div><p>Going to fraternity parties my freshman year, I started to realize how closely intertwined sex was to alcohol culture. That was really problematic for me. I felt really uncomfortable not really being able to give consent, and watching a lot of my friends engage in sexual activity that they may or may not have wanted to engage in intentionally. I feel like there was a lack of intention in the sex community here &hellip; It just happens and no one will reflect on it. We reflect on it with all of our friends, but we don&rsquo;t actually talk to the actual sexual partner who we have had sex with.</p><p><em>On being polyamorous:</em></p><p>As I got older, I would say I became polyamorous, which means multiple loves. I think that was the biggest transition or transformation &ndash; my openness and vulnerability to multiple romantic partners, not just one. I had this notion of one-on-one relationships, and now I have this notion of &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; romance where everyone is connected. Just because I say I&rsquo;m in a relationship with one person &ndash; and in this case I use &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; interchangeably with &ldquo;sex&rdquo; &ndash; I&rsquo;m also in relationships with all of those people that that person is in relationships with. I&rsquo;m not living one-on-one with anyone; I&rsquo;m living in a system of inter-subjective relationships and interconnectedness. I always want to know who my sexual partners are also having sex with so I can know that better as a sexual being. It&rsquo;s just sexual maturity &ndash; coming to terms with your ability to love many different people and your ability to be in relationships with a whole system of people.</p><p><em>On dating a monogamist: &nbsp;</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m currently in a complicated relationship. I&rsquo;m romantically involved with someone who has a girlfriend. That&rsquo;s been very transformative for me because I started to grapple with the notion that not everyone is going to practice sex in the same ways that I do. &nbsp;There are going to be people who just want to have only one sexual partner. But then there&rsquo;s also this notion of, &lsquo;we love each other romantically and we are sexually attracted to each other&rsquo; and we [the man and I] have discussed this. There&rsquo;s this illusion of a constraint that&rsquo;s from preventing us from loving each other the way we want to.</p><p>I&rsquo;m questioning his relationship to sex. I&rsquo;m questioning why he thinks that that&rsquo;s a constraint in his life. Why does he think that his girlfriend, one person, prevents him from others? So now that&rsquo;s kind of the question I&rsquo;m dealing with in my modern sex life: How can I deal with my relationship, my sexually-attracted relationship, to this man who I see multiple times a week and don&rsquo;t act on that intention? It&rsquo;s a challenge because I&rsquo;m just trying to be comfortable with doing that.&nbsp;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
