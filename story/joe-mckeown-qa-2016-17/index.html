With a strong core of seniors returning to Evanston for the 2016-17 season, McKeown and Co. are looking to reach their second NCAA Tournament in four years.</p><p><strong>On the growth of senior stars Nia Coffey, Ashley Deary and Christen Inman:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I hope a lot better. We&rsquo;ve done some things in Chicago and just taking the team to Europe this summer I think for them, to put them into leadership roles and see how they responded and, I think the basketball part, they are who they are, and that will take care of itself and they&rsquo;ve had great careers. I think now being leaders, captains, it&rsquo;s a new identity for them and they are doing a great job of wanting to take on that responsibility.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On the big three taking underclassmen under their wings:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something that [the coaches] have spent a lot of time with the [seniors] about. &lsquo;What do you want your legacy and identity to be?&rsquo; They&rsquo;ve broken a lot of records here as players individually and as teams, by getting to the NCAA Tournament. You gotta give back, you&rsquo;ve gotta want to give back. I think that&rsquo;s really the one thing they are proud of and trying to do a real good job of.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On where the outside shooting will come from:</strong></p><p>[Maggie Lyon] is a big loss, not just because she could shoot, but she was a great leader, great role model for our program and just an incredible career, and she is playing in Spain,and we are really proud of her. It&rsquo;s hard to replace how fearless she was as a shooter. She had amnesia, so if she missed a shot, she would come right back at you. We will miss that, but I think other people [like] Lydia Rohde right now are shooting the ball well, and we get Lauren Douglas back this year who has been one of the best threats in the B1G as a three-point shooter. I think Jordan Hankins can really shoot, so we have [some shooters.] Abi Scheid, who is a freshman, a 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; post player, and same with Oceana [Hamilton] shoot threes as well as they do layups. I don&rsquo;t know what that says about their layups, but we will find out.</p><p><strong>On the impact of freshman this season:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s so early right now that we are trying to figure things out. I think when we went to France and played a little bit, [Abi and Byrdy] both played well and adapted well to our system. So now it&rsquo;s just getting through the nonconference and getting opportunities. They both are really good basketball players.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On the added depth in front court:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I think in general having more size gives us the ability to bring people in if we are in foul trouble. We will be able to throw in a lot of bodies in the B1G. [Since the B1G] has been throwing a lot of bodies at us, since I&rsquo;ve been here, we&rsquo;ll start throwing them back.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On the team&rsquo;s strengths:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We were able to score last year. We scored a lot of points and had [some good] games, but defensively we struggled at times. I think this team has addressed that they&rsquo;ve got to be a better defensive team, and they take pride right now in it at practice. That&rsquo;s got to be our strength this year. I feel like we can score still. We will have our ups and down, just like any team offensively, and I think right now if we can defend and rebound, and the team is buying in, that can be our identity that gets us through the tough shooting nights.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On the importance of transition game:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We are a very good transition team when we take care of the ball and get really good shots. I saw it last year in spurts, and the way we finished in the B1G Tournament with a great run there by playing four straight games and winning three games in a row, I thought our transition game was in high gear. We didn&rsquo;t turn the ball over, and our shot selection was good. Everyone says they want to run, but then they go and take crazy shots. That&rsquo;s a big area we need to improve.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>On the pressure to reach the NCAA Tournament:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel any pressure, you know. I think [the seniors] feel like that&rsquo;s their goal. I feel like every coach this time of year wants to get back to the tournament, but I want [the team] to just play. [The seniors] don&rsquo;t want their legacies to be they just played in one tournament game. There are some things you don&rsquo;t have to say that they get. Last year at this time we were ranked 12th in the country, so they understand the bar and the level [of play.] The Tournament is a special thing, and you can&rsquo;t take anything for granted. I learned that when I came here after being in 17 of them. You&rsquo;ve got to appreciate the grind to get there and the league. The B1G is going to give us some tremendous opportunities, so it&rsquo;s really up to us to take advantage.</p><p><strong>On the team chemistry:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I think everyone loves each other in October. That&rsquo;s every team in college basketball. I think these guys are resilient, and that&rsquo;s best when things don&rsquo;t go well. We have seniors now who have been in crunch time and been in a lot of battles. They know what it&rsquo;s like to be on the road in the B1G in February, and that&rsquo;s where I think the senior leadership will really show. This team is committed to each other, and I don&rsquo;t think they care who scores or who plays. Last year we just had a tough stretch, where like any team, we got beat at the buzzer a couple time. I think the way we came on at the B1G Tournament also said a lot about the character of our seniors and how proud they are in this program. I think each team is different each year.&rdquo;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
