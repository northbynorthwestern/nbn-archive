The Bears have it. So Chicago&#8217;s going to win, right?</p><p><strong>First Quarter</strong></p><p>5:29 &#8211; Unreal. Devin Hester just single-handedly crushed Indianapolis. I&#8217;ve always thought it was a little premature when every sports announcer anointed him the Messiah of kick returns, but now I&#8217;m a believer. Turns out that coin flip did make a difference.</p><p>5:31 &#8211; Colts fans dreaming of a kick return TD of their own. Not so much.</p><p>5:36 &#8211; Technical difficulties are making this live blog a little difficult. On the last drive, false starts and the Bears D rendered the Colts hapless.</p><p>5:38 -On 3rd and 4, Grossman (Good Rex or Bad Rex?) goes deep, but to no avail. Broadcasters&#8217; hopes for a punt return for a touchdown are not realized.</p><p>5:43 &#8211; On 3rd and 2, the broadcasters helpfully tell us that it&#8217;s not good to give up a big pass to any team. Yeah, thanks. Should a team score points to win, too?</p><p>5:44 Colts pick up a first down. Peyton zips the ball for 5 yards.</p><p>5:45 &#8211; A lovely little video and discussion about Peyton Manning&#8217;s injured thumb. What do you do if it&#8217;s the fourth quarter and your thumb is bleeding? Suck on it, apparently.</p><p>5:46 &#8211; A dropped pass puts Peyton with a third and long, which he converts into a touchdown. Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty sure his thumb&#8217;s okay.</p><p>5:48 &#8211; But who&#8217;s thumb&#8217;s not okay? The fool from the Colts who decided now would be a good time to do his Tony Romo impression. Bears 7, Colts 6.</p><p>5:50 &#8211; &#8220;More like Super Botch, am I right?&#8221; So says Patrick St. Michel as Devon Hester fumbles the ball.</p><p>5:51 &#8211; But it&#8217;s short lived as a Colts receiver fumbles the ball and the Bears recover it. Could the rain be playing a factor in this game?</p><p>5:52 &#8211; All those problems that the Colts run defense were having seem to have come back. Thomas Jones rips through the Colts to bring it to the 5.</p><p>5:55 &#8211; No botched snaps here, as the Bears pick up an extra point after a Moose reception. Bears 14, Colts 6</p><p>6:00 &#8211; This is the second consecutive play where the Colts seem to be running the wrong direction. Whomp whomp.</p><p>6:03 &#8211; Devon Hester teases us with the beginnings of a big return, but instead goes only a few yards.</p><p>6:04 &#8211; Zebras convene and finally determine that a pass was a pushout and was, in fact, a reception for a first down.</p><p>6:06 &#8211; Ian Scott gets a &#8220;paw&#8221; on a pass and tips it, according to the commentators. I don&#8217;t know it that was a Bears joke or not, but I&#8217;d like to think it was, giving creedence to my theory that sports announcers are only slighter more intelligent than models.</p><p>6:07 &#8211; An encroachment call gives the Colts more yards. Unfortunately, they elect not to go for a fake and just do the punt.</p><p>6:12 &#8211; Back on after more tehcnical difficulties. Bears fans go through a scare when Cedric Benson takes a while to get up from a nasty hit.</p><p>6:13 &#8211; With seconds left in the quarter, a Chicago punt puts the ball just shy of the 50.</p><p>6:14 &#8211; What could be more horrific than replaying the Benson hit again? Showing David Spade. Anyone who watches his new show doesn&#8217;t deserve to eat.</p><p>6:15 &#8211; End of the first quarter. It&#8217;s been ugly, what with the four turnovers, botched snap and relentless rain. Bears 14, Colts 6.</p><p><strong>Second Quarter</strong></p><p>6:18 &#8211; Nice pass from Manning to give the Colts a first down. Even bigger props to CBS&#8217;s sound guys, who managed to amplify the sound of the reception so much that my chest kind of stung after hearing it.</p><p>6:19 &#8211; Announcers advise us to not watch the gyrations during the Manning show. No comment.</p><p>6:24 &#8211; Oh wireless, how you vex me. While I was gone, the Colts managed to not botch a snap and pick up a field goal. Bears 14, Colts 9</p><p>6:35 &#8211; Surprisingly, Hester doesn&#8217;t return the punt. Instead, Rasheed Davis does something unremarkable.</p><p>6:27 &#8211; How long before someone made a ham-fisted comment about the black head coaches? Just until now, when someone brings it up by mentioning that February is Black History Month.</p><p>6:28 &#8211; Nasty tackle and the Bears have to kick it back.</p><p>6:30 &#8211; Who failed meteorology school? Worst banter ever.</p><p>6:31 &#8211; Nice pass from Peyton. The second quarter is shaping up to be much better than the first. Ditto for his next pass.</p><p>6:32 &#8211; The rain is so bad, it&#8217;s even difficult to see through the camera lens. I wonder if this is going to hamper Prince&#8217;s halftime performance. My goodness, I hope not.</p><p>6:33 &#8211; Colts are in striking distance, picking up another first down, then coming just short of a TD. Looks like Peyton&#8217;s good at doing things outside of the advertising world.</p><p>6:34 &#8211; Indy picks up a TD. After a mini-debate about whether to go for 2, they end up just going for the PAT and not botching the snap. Colts 16, Bears 14. </p><p>6:36 &#8211; Coolest graphic ever? I love it when they draw lines on the field. The jumbotron on the field, though, not so much.</p><p>6:45 &#8211; Wireless cut out, erasing the last 10 minutes of posts. Needless to say, not much happened.</p><p>6:48 &#8211; With about a foot to go for the first down, the Colts get it. Ever since the second Bears score, it&#8217;s been the Manning show.</p><p>6:49 &#8211; And literally as I type that, the Bears cause a fumble and pick up possession.</p><p>6:50 &#8211; But it&#8217;s shortlived, as another fumble gives it back to the Colts. Rex botched the snap. It&#8217;s ugly.</p><p>6:52 &#8211; I suddenly realize how little time is left in the quarter. With 49 seconds left, the Colts make another pretty play. It&#8217;s back to the Manning show.</p><p>6:52 &#8211; FG attempt with a couple of seconds left. The Colts almost botch it by letting time run out. That would have been the ultimate Tony Romo moment.</p><p>6:55 &#8211; Yeah, Lovie Smith. Calling a timeout right before Viniatieri kicks is going to put enough pressure on him to miss. I&#8217;m pretty sure he never responds to pressure. </p><p>6:56 &#8211; To cover my tracks, I&#8217;m going to tell you to read the last post as completely serious. Since Adam &#8220;Iceman&#8221; Viniatieri just missed the FG.</p><p>6:56 &#8211; With the end of the quarter, the score remains Colts 16, Bears 14. It&#8217;s been an alright game, but imagine how it would be without the rain.<br />
Alright, I&#8217;m out. Enjoy Prince! I hope he plays &#8220;Kiss.&#8221; That song rules.</p><p><strong>Third Quarter</strong></p><p>7:26 &#8211; And we&#8217;re back. Prince was cool and the flag shadow thing was cool enough to make me ignore the absence of &#8220;Kiss.&#8221; The Bears kick off and Ind has it on the 38.</p><p>7:28 &#8211; The Bears D really hasn&#8217;t shown up for, say, the last quarter. </p><p>7:29 &#8211; And Manning picks up the award for the least graceful pass ever. Seriously, that looked painful. </p><p>7:30 &#8211; Speaking of painful, Utecht is hurt. Oh dear. Maybe a crushing hit was what the Bears D needed to get started again.<br />
Apparently not. Colts pick up another first down.</p><p>7:33 &#8211; I swear, the commentator just spoke in mock Ebonics. All that talk about this game being big for African-Americans just got set back. </p><p>7:34 &#8211; Offsides? Nope, it&#8217;s actually a false start. Not even Peyton&#8217;s imitation of the Bears could convince the officials otherwise.</p><p>7:36 &#8211; Dungy just challenges the number of players on the field. Could the quick snap have really worked? No, the commentators count it down Sesame Street-style (11, 11 defenders on the field) and we see that this was really the lamest challenge ever.</p><p>7:38 &#8211; Yup, that was a pretty wasteful challenge. Dungy&#8217;s probably going to want that timeout back later.</p><p>7:39 &#8211; So Viniatieri hasn&#8217;t totally lost it. Colts 19, Bears 14.</p><p>7:42 &#8211; Here comes Rex Grossman. It feels like it&#8217;s been ages since we saw him last.</p><p>7:45 &#8211; It&#8217;s been 56 minutes, to be exact. But they apparently used their time off well, picking up a first down on a Thomas Jones run.</p><p>7:46 &#8211; Grossman&#8217;s under pressure. He couldn&#8217;t have handled it any worse, tripping and making it 3rd &#038; 12.</p><p>7:47 &#8211; Now he botched the snap. Ouch, ouch, ouch. </p><p>7:49 &#8211; Right, I&#8217;m really going to vote for the MVP by texting a player&#8217;s full name. Could they have chosen a more obnoxious way for fans to vote?</p><p>7:50 &#8211; Wow, Rhodes picks up a huge run and the Colts are on the 28.</p><p>7:51 &#8211; And just like that, there&#8217;s a facemask and the Colts are on the 10.</p><p>7:53 &#8211; Three plays and the Colts aren&#8217;t in the endzone. Go for it? I would have, but Dungy&#8217;s calling in the Iceman. </p><p>7:54 &#8211; It looks like a foul, but Indy wisely declines it. Colts 22, Bears 14.</p><p>7:58 &#8211; The Bears don&#8217;t even need Devon Hester to score big on the kick return. A personal foul puts the ball close to the 40. </p><p>8:02  &#8211; Maybe Rex should just stick to the running game, as his pass falls&#8230;nowhere. </p><p>8:03 &#8211; Rex runs around like a chicken without a head before almost throwing a pick. Two Colts defenders do a well-coordinated dance.</p><p>8:04 &#8211; Uber-consistent Robbie Gould executes on the field goal. He was almost MVP of my league-winning fantasy football team. Colts 22, Bears 17.</p><p>8:05 &#8211; Pretty cool shot of the cameraman being knocked over into a puddle. Somebody get him a towel.</p><p>8:07 &#8211; Two officials duke it out (sort of) over whether Harrison has possession before going out of bounds. Dungy rightly challenges the call of incomplete pass.</p><p>8:09 &#8211; And the call gets overturned, giving Indy a 3rd and 2. Peyton zips the pass to Reggie Wayne and picks up another first down to end the quarter.</p><p><strong>Fourth Quarter</strong></p><p>8:13 &#8211; A false start on Indy gets erased on a 5-yard run. </p><p>8:17 &#8211; Big ol&#8217; pass from Manning, a possible fumble, a nasty fall for Harrison and it all ends in an incomplete. Anticlimatic as what.</p><p>8:19 &#8211; A holding call erases a Thomas Jones first down. I like to equate big holding fouls like that with missed free throws in basketball. They just shouldn&#8217;t happen if you&#8217;re, you know, a professional athlete.</p><p>8:20 &#8211; Wait, I thought bad Rex was playing this game. He throws a laser to Moose.</p><p>8:21- Oh, I was right. Rexy throws an interception and the Colts run it back for a TD. Uh oh, challenge. Was he out of bounds? It&#8217;s close. </p><p>8:24 &#8211; The call stands, but let&#8217;s not fault Lovie for the challenge. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as that pile of &#8220;12 players on the field&#8221; that Dungy pulled earlier.</p><p>8:25 &#8211; Viniatieri gets the extra point. I almost wrote &#8220;shanks the kick&#8221; to sound like the guys on ESPN, but then I remembered that that&#8217;s a really bad expression and it just doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p><p>8:28 &#8211; It&#8217;s wicked wet out there. This could be the first time I&#8217;ve ever been glad I don&#8217;t have Super Bowl tickets.</p><p>8:30- There goes another Grossman interception. There&#8217;s a flag on the play, though.</p><p>8:31 &#8211; The ref bumbles his way through announcing two personal fouls, so nothing happens. Except for him looking like a fool.</p><p>8:33 &#8211; Manning calls a timeout, but the center must have missed the memo, since he snaps it anyway. It&#8217;s awkward.</p><p>8:36 &#8211; Sack. It puts the Colts out of field goal range, so it&#8217;s a pretty big play. Indy is forced to punt.</p><p>8:38 &#8211; Indy is called for delay of game on the punt, but they still get it off effectively.</p><p>8:41 &#8211; There&#8217;s a QB stats comparison and it doesn&#8217;t look good at all for Rex Grossman. </p><p>8:41 &#8211; Thomas Jones almost fumbles it, but it ends up looking cool when he catches it off his own arms. </p><p>8:44 &#8211; After some unremarkable Bears runs, Marvin Jackson is down with a nasty shoulder injury. Why is CBS so obsessed with showing us these painful injuries in excruciating slow motion?</p><p>8:45 &#8211; Just when it looks like Grossman had done something good and picked up a first down on 4th &#038; 9, Jones drops the ball.</p><p>8:49 &#8211; There&#8217;s a holding call against Indianapolis, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter anymore. Unless Rex gets bit by a radioactive spider or something, this game&#8217;s over.</p><p>8:50 &#8211; They show a shot of Rex Grossman&#8217;s sad, pudgy face that&#8217;s almost as depressing as that one GM commercial with the suicidal manufacturing robot.</p><p>8:55 &#8211; It&#8217;s time for a little Dungy lovin&#8217;. Apparently the only time he swore was when he said &#8220;Best Damn Shorts Show Period.&#8221; So he&#8217;s Mormon?</p><p>8:58 &#8211; Dungy gets his well-earned Gatorade bath and Peyton Manning picks up a well-earned Super Bowl ring with a final score of 29-17. Congrats to the Colts.<br />
My pick for MVP? Rain. Followed by Prince.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
