Most moviegoers will remember Bradley Cooper as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_2ADWBZgS8">jackass boyfriend</a> in <em>Wedding Crashers</em>, the jackass husband in <em>He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You</em> or as Jim Carrey&#8217;s stalwart best friend in <em>Yes Man</em>. But this summer, Cooper finally steps into the front lines as the star of <em>The Hangover</em>. Opening in theaters June 5, <em>The Hangover</em> is a crazy, <em>Old School</em>-esque comedy that follows three men as they retrace their steps after a blacked-out night in Las Vegas. Cooper spoke to North by Northwestern during a round table interview about shooting in Vegas, playing the alpha male and his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83gPBfUGVwc">crazy role</a> on <em>Nip/Tuck</em>.</p><p><strong>What was the most enjoyable part about working on the movie?</strong></p><p>Probably just being around Todd Phillips [the director]. He&#8217;s a pretty cool guy. And being around him and Zach (Galifianakis) and Ed (Helms). Shooting in Vegas was hard. We were in Caesar&#8217;s Palace for a month and a half, that was pretty crazy. A month and a half is [when] you go past the point of no return.</p><p><strong>Was working on this movie more fun than <em>Wedding Crashers</em>?</strong></p><p>It was different, totally different. But I liked it because I was able to be a bigger part of the movie. So that was cool, to be creatively [involved], to be really telling the story in a more thorough way. But <em>Wedding Crashers</em> was amazing too, but that was my first really big studio movie, so that was great for so many reasons. I was a lot younger, crazier then. And being around Owen (Wilson) and Vince (Vaughn) was great. And (Christopher) Walken, I mean that was amazing. [...] He was the best, he was insane. I actually got to become buddies with him. He was very open, available. But this movie, I got to say, this was the best thing I&#8217;ve ever been involved with.</p><p><strong>In most of your roles, even if you have a smaller part like in <em>Wedding Crashers</em>, everybody remembers you. Do you feel like that&#8217;s close to your personality at all?</strong></p><p>(laughs) No, not at all. But obviously it&#8217;s somewhere in there. It came out.</p><p><strong>How was the chemistry with the other guys off set?</strong></p><p>We became friends. It felt like we did a war movie together. I mean, we get the shit kicked out of each other in this movie, and it was like being in the trenches together. So we actually, Ed and I, went to Zach&#8217;s farm for New Years, and we actually are buddies now. I love those guys.</p><p><strong>So did you guys do any partying while you were in Vegas?</strong></p><p>The thing about it is, how are you going to one-up what you just did. You come from set where you were like, there&#8217;s an Asian naked guy on your neck. And then there&#8217;s the tiger. You know, so what are you going to do, go to a bar and get drunk? Is that going to be crazy? You couldn&#8217;t surpass what we filmed. So it was pretty much just resting, a lot of sleeping between. We were doing 16-hour days, six days a week in Vegas, and we shot a lot at night too. So you know, getting up at like three in the morning to go to work, it was weird hours.</p><p><strong>The show <em>Nip/Tuck</em> has gone miles in different directions, how did you get into your role on that show?</strong></p><p>That was crazy, right? A lot of that was improvised, I mean a lot of that. Which is awesome for a TV show to let that happen, I&#8217;ve never experienced that on a TV show, ever. That kind of latitude they would give me to do. I love that character &#8212; Ryan Murphy and I just came up with that guy, what would it be like if a 15-year-old who has way too much access, you know. And he&#8217;s just fucking out of his mind, he just wants to devour and he&#8217;s so insecure at the same time. Yeah, that was a ball, I would do a hundred more of them.</p><p><strong>What is the difference in difficulty between shooting television and film?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s pretty much the same. I mean, it&#8217;s the same concept. The only difference is that in a TV show, it&#8217;s more of a machine. You&#8217;re shooting more pages in a day than in a movie. And also, on a network show, there&#8217;s no end, you don&#8217;t really know where the story&#8217;s going. Where film is, you have beginning, middle, end, you shoot it and it comes out later, which I prefer. It&#8217;s a more sort of encapsulized creative process. Where, in TV, you&#8217;re beholden to the network and what they want to do, depending on how the viewers see your character, stuff like that.</p><p><strong>The photos in the end credits are pretty outrageous, how did you go about taking those?</strong></p><p>We took them during the movie. Which was smart &#8212; every place we shot, Todd would take us off and we&#8217;d do stuff. We shot in the strip club, and we&#8217;d also take random people off the street and ask them to do crazy shit. And they&#8217;d do it, which you&#8217;ll see in this film.</p><p><strong>Were there any injuries from all the crazy stunts you guys had to do?</strong></p><p>Yeah, we were pretty sore, we got banged up. No irreparable damage, but we got banged up pretty bad.</p><p><strong>I heard a lot the script was largely improvised. How did you fit improvisation into such a complex plot?</strong></p><p>That&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a lot of filler, in the parts of the script where we&#8217;d, say, [have] three guys wait for the car to come up in the valet and there&#8217;s no dialogue. In that scene, I&#8217;m getting a ticket, Zach&#8217;s talking about Coffee Bean and where he picks up kids, he&#8217;s putting blue blockers on the baby. So all that stuff is filler that sort of brings everything to life. So that&#8217;s how it works it&#8217;s way in.</p><p><strong>What was the most challenging part about this role?</strong></p><p>Well he&#8217;s the leader, and I think there&#8217;s a sort of energy you need to have as the sort of leader of the group, keeping the ship together before it falls apart. So I think just being able to play that sort of alpha male for the whole movie was challenging, I didn&#8217;t know if I could do it. And then I sort of realized that I was just playing Todd Phillips, so it was easy, I just mimicked him.</p><p><strong>On set, do you have any sort of day-to-day routine you use to prepare?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;d be so cool if I had one, but no. It mainly consists of trying to get something to eat, I&#8217;ll try to actually do something physical before. But it&#8217;s so run and gun, you sort of enter into the movie and then you come out the other side. There is no day, it&#8217;s like the whole thing. Once you start the movie, you sort of get into that black hole, and you don&#8217;t come out until it&#8217;s over. [...] [We went] four days in Vegas, didn&#8217;t see day light, that&#8217;s crazy.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
