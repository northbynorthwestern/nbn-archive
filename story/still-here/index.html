Yes, I was still there. I had been standing there for the past hour and I sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere. The exasperation on Mr. Savoy&rsquo;s face as he looked down at me in my sodden business suit, standing outside on his exalted front porch in the pouring rain, infuriated me.</p><p>My main problem was not with Mr. Savoy but with Clayton Greystone. Mr. Savoy&rsquo;s association with Greystone Empire lay mainly in the fact that he was married to Mrs. Elizabeth Greystone, widow to the dearly departed Mr. Greystone.</p><p>&ldquo;How did you even get onto this property again?&rdquo; Mr. Savoy demanded looking down at my 5-foot-3 frame.</p><p>&rdquo;Clayton,&rdquo; I seethed.</p><p>I met Clayton Greystone while working at the Greystone PR Company. Clayton was &ldquo;working&rsquo;&rdquo; in the company and doing some PR to meet the &ldquo;common folk&rsquo;&rdquo; when we met. He was charming and funny. And I fell for it. While Clayton and I were still in a sham of a relationship, he brought me over to one of his family&rsquo;s homes and gave me the passcodes. At the time I thought that it meant our relationship was real and growing deeper but I came to realize that he had a horde of women patrolling in and out of the estate. He dumped me as soon as I let him know he couldn&rsquo;t exactly live that same lifestyle with a toddler in tow because I was pregnant. He didn&rsquo;t take that too well.</p><p>&ldquo;Clayton is otherwise preoccupied,&rdquo; Geoffrey said shortly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s poised to run a multimillion dollar corporation and doesn&rsquo;t have time for false accusations and upstart tramps that don&rsquo;t have the sense to know when something has run its due course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;<em>False accusations</em>?&rdquo; I echoed back, shocked. I could feel myself getting hot all over. &ldquo;<em>Tramp</em>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; I said, flicking my hair out of my face. &ldquo;How about I go to the <em>Post</em> and find out what they think about my baby? I&rsquo;ll get the rumor mill going. You might try to deny it but people will still wonder. So you better get Clayton Greystone out here NOW because I&rsquo;m not going anywhere until HIS BABY is taken care of. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>I panted heavily as I continued to lock eyes with Geoffrey. I wasn&rsquo;t some gold digging whore Clayton had picked up off the street.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this noise?&rdquo; said a voice from behind Geoffrey. The door widened to reveal Mrs. Greystone. I could tell she had been standing there for a while before she finally spoke. &ldquo;Come inside! The weather is dreadful.&rdquo;</p><p>A beat passed before Geoffrey fully opened the door and another before I eventually stepped in. My confidence and anger melted away as I stood there like a sodden rat on their beautiful white marble floor. What was I doing? What were the odds that any of this was going to work?</p><p>&ldquo;I always find it better to deal with certain delicate matters while one is dry and with a cup of tea in hand,&rdquo; Elizabeth said. &ldquo;Come upstairs with me and we&rsquo;ll get you something dry to change into.&rdquo;</p><p>As I followed Elizabeth Greystone up the nearby stairs and into a guest bedroom, I realized even more how out of my depth I truly was. She pressed a button on a nearby intercom as I gazed around at the opulent room.</p><p>&ldquo;Please bring up a spare set of clothes,&rdquo; said Elizabeth into the intercom and then turned to face me. &ldquo;You just missed Clayton, I&rsquo;m afraid. He flew out to Milan for a fashion show with a female friend. I believe she was walking in the runway and he wanted to show some support.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, that hurt. Clayton had moved on with a model.</p><p>In the doorway of the room, a short woman appeared. &ldquo;Mrs. Greystone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I brought the clothes you asked for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great. Be sure to help this poor girl. She looks a little shocked. I&rsquo;ll see you downstairs shortly,&rdquo; she said as she swept out the door. &ldquo;Come into the sitting room just off the entrance and we&rsquo;ll get this all sorted out.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat down on the bed not caring that I was still soaking wet and probably ruining an expensive duvet. I realized then that I was alone.</p><p>Well. Not actually. I did have my baby and Mrs. Greystone&rsquo;s maid. Both of which were no help to me now. As I stared at this woman, I started to cry.</p><p>I heard a flurry of steps but couldn&rsquo;t see since my vision was so clouded by my tears.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, now,&rdquo; she cooed in her Southern accent as she smoothed down my sopping wet curls. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to pull yourself together.&rdquo;</p><p>But the woman let me cry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; I said as I started to get up and tried to resist the urges of the woman to stay seated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you and I&rsquo;m scared and I&rsquo;m broke and&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shhhh,&rdquo; she said as I finally gave up the fight to get up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll all be alright. You&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ve taken care of Mr. Clayton since he was born so I know him well. He will do right by his child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will," I said shaking my head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off to Milan to go be with some <em>model</em> and probably doesn&rsquo;t even care about his own <em>baby</em> and doesn&rsquo;t probably think it&rsquo;s even <em>his</em> baby.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Clayton may have made some mistakes with his children in the past but &ndash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I cut her off. &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;God knows I love that boy like he was my own but he was going to have to face the music sometime.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe because I looked pathetic, but probably because she was old and overworked, she had let slip some important information about Clayton Greystone. I was probably just another in a long line of women.</p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to get what I wanted out of them and I wanted more than just cash. I wanted my baby to be accepted and to have a family. My baby deserved to be loved and wanted, not treated like a dark dirty family secret. I needed to get out of there.</p><p>&rdquo;Could you give me a moment to change?&rdquo; I sniffed.</p><p>The woman smiled and winked. &ldquo;You do what&rsquo;s best for yourself, dear,&rdquo; she said, and left the room.</p><p>I fumbled around for my phone and found it mercifully dry. I dialed an Uber to meet me at the front gate. I got up, took a breath, and tried to get my bearings. There was nothing here for me or my child. I slipped out of the room and down the stairs quietly. I could hear a faint rustle coming from the sitting room. I opened the front door and just like that, we were gone.</p><p>***</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Elizabeth as she took a sip of her tea. &ldquo;She left maybe five minutes ago. I heard the door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; said Geoffrey as he took a long swallow of brandy. &ldquo;She was more of a problem than she was worth. We have enough to deal with.&rdquo;</p><p>Elizabeth didn&rsquo;t respond as she put down her cup and looked out at the window that showed a beautiful view of the property. She made a mental note to make sure the girl did not actually go to the <em>Post</em>.</p><p>But the Greystones underestimated the combination of a scorned woman and a pregnancy.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
