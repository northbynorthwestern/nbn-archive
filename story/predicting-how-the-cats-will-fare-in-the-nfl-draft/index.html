While the Wildcats&rsquo; Class of 2012 lacks the prestige of those drafted in 2010 (Corey Wootton, fourth round; Mike Kafka, fourth round; Sherrick McManis, fifth round), several of these eight could hear their names called Saturday. And with <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7847355/nfl-boosts-offseason-roster-limit-90-players"><span class="s1">preseason rosters expanding from 80 to 90 players per team</span></a> this season, each of these eight players could get the chance to compete for a roster spot in training camp.&nbsp;</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p2"></p><div class="sidebar"><strong>NOTABLE NU ALUMS IN THE NFL&nbsp;</strong><p class="p2"></p><strong>Corey Wootton, Chicago Bears, Round 4, 109 overall&nbsp;</strong><p class="p2"></p>
Once considered a possible second round pick, a torn knee in the 2008 finale set Wootton back before his senior year. With several minor injuries in the NFL, he&rsquo;s struggled to get on the field for Chicago and is best known for his only sack of his career, which gave Brett Favre a concussion and ended his final season in the NFL.&nbsp;
<p class="p2"></p><strong>Mike Kafka, Philadelphia Eagles, Round 4, 122 overall&nbsp;</strong><p class="p2"></p>
Kafka&rsquo;s time in Philadelphia has been relatively quiet, although he replaced Michael Vick in the second half of a game against Atlanta last season and nearly engineered a comeback victory.&nbsp;
<p class="p2"></p><strong>Sherrick McManis, Houston Texans, Round 5, 144 overall&nbsp;</strong><p class="p2"></p>
McManis has seen time in 23 games in two years for the Texans, all as a reserve. He has one career interception and one forced fumble, but otherwise has had little impact.</div><p class="p1"><b>DAN PERSA, Quarterback</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Despite a promising junior season, Persa&rsquo;s draft status has been immeasurably damaged by the ruptured Achilles he sustained late 2010 against Iowa. Not only did he struggle to return to the field and produce at a high level, but Persa&rsquo;s right calf (the previously injured leg) is still visibly smaller than his left. He's already undersized for a typical NFL quarterback, and his lack of mobility showed during the season and in the East-West Shrine Game. A lackluster 40-yard dash (4.85) at NU&rsquo;s pro day didn&rsquo;t help things, as scouts know he needs to be healthy and mobile to make an impact in the NFL. As a result, despite being the all-time NCAA leader in completion percentage, Persa will likely be passed over in the draft. Still, expect him to be signed as an undrafted free agent by a team willing to give him time to get healthy.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Undrafted free agent, signs with New York Giants</i></p><p class="p1">With the Giants&rsquo; QB situation set for years (see Manning, Eli) and David Carr set as the backup, Persa would have the time to regain his strength and mobility while learning under offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>JEREMY EBERT, Wide Receiver</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Despite displaying impressive production when paired with a quality throwing quarterback, Ebert&rsquo;s stock had been surprisingly low through February; he wasn&rsquo;t even invited to the NFL Combine. But with a tremendous 4.38-second 40-yard dash at Northwestern&rsquo;s Pro Day, Ebert has silenced scouts&rsquo; questions about his speed. While ESPN draft analyst Todd McShay calls Ebert&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/chi-espns-mcshay-analyzes-nus-top-nfl-prospects-20120417,0,7352408.story"><span class="s1">&ldquo;more quick than fast,&rdquo;</span></a>&nbsp;he clearly has the skill set of a slot receiver who can consistently beat opposing teams&rsquo; nickel cornerbacks, similar to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/weswelker/2505790/profile"><span class="s1">Wes Welker</span></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/dannyamendola/2649/profile"><span class="s1">Danny Amendola</span></a>. With the growing emphasis on passing in the NFL, Ebert could be a slot solution for several teams and could even go as early as the fifth round.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Sixth round, 179th&nbsp;overall, New Orleans Saints</i></p><p class="p1">Despite all of their weapons, New Orleans doesn&rsquo;t have a true slot-specific receiver who can sit down in zone coverage and pick up easy gains. Ebert would be a low-risk, high-reward option who could be maximized in the Saints&rsquo; system and help fill the role of Robert Meachem, who departed to San Diego in free agency.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>DRAKE DUNSMORE, Tight End</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Dunsmore certainly made the most of his <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-combine/09000d5d827c163e/2012-Combine-workout-Drake-Dunsmore)."><span class="s1">belated invitation to the NFL Combine</span></a>. Dunsmore ranked among the top five tight ends in every drill except the broad jump, and he had the fastest short shuttle and three-cone drill times of any tight end. Dunsmore is small for his position, measuring in at just 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; and 241 lbs., so many scouts see him as more of an H-back. Still, with his athleticism and ability to catch the ball from several positions in the formation, Dunsmore should be drafted with a chance to contribute early.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Sixth round, 203rd&nbsp;overall, New York Jets</i></p><p class="p1">Mark Sanchez needs more weapons at every position, and Dunsmore could be useful as a receiver while he bulks up as a blocker. Having an extra target who could line up in the backfield or as an in-line tight end would help Sanchez get rid of the ball quickly in blitz situations.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>AL NETTER, Offensive Line</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Netter&rsquo;s greatest value to NFL teams will be his versatility and ability to play multiple positions. As starter at tackle, Netter was consistent but never truly exceptional for the &lsquo;Cats. Most scouts see him as a guard in the NFL, and he showed a willingness to play the position in the <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-20/sports/ct-spt-0121-east-west-shrine--20120121_1_locals-fare-nfl-evaluators-front-office"><span class="s1">East-West Shrine Game</span></a>. Playing guard should give Netter more professional options because coaches prefer to carry fewer backup linemen who can play multiple positions. Though it&rsquo;s possible Netter goes as high as the fifth round, it wouldn&rsquo;t be shocking if he went undrafted and signed quickly with a team in free agency.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Seventh round, 211th&nbsp;overall, Cleveland Browns</i></p><p class="p1">With top-flight starters at both left tackle and center, Cleveland could use a backup that could swing to either guard position or play at right tackle if necessary. As a smart and tough player, Netter would be valuable when working with elite players around him.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>JACK DiNARDO, Defensive Tackle</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Though he never stood out as a star for Northwestern, DiNardo&rsquo;s four seasons at Northwestern have earned him a legitimate shot at the NFL. His measurable skills aren&rsquo;t great among NFL prospects, but he&rsquo;s demonstrated enough mobility and intelligence to interest a team in free agency. Still, there&rsquo;s a chance that very few teams come calling.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Undrafted free agent, signs with Tennessee Titans</i></p><p class="p1">Tennessee&rsquo;s defensive line has lost tremendous talent over the last few offseasons and needs to reestablish the depth behind its starters. A traditional 4-3 tackle that can get penetration could catch their eye.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>VINCE BROWNE, Defensive End</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">After a stellar junior year with eight sacks and 15.5 tackles for loss, Browne looked to be following Wootton as a potential mid-round pick at defensive end.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Browne failed to build on a quality junior season with a lackluster final year at Northwestern, but he does have the physical tools to become a rotational player at the next level. His good size (6'5", 265 lbs.) and speed (4.86 low in the 40-yard dash) should help him find a team in free agency, although a lack of production will <a href="http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/dsprofile.php?pyid=68797&amp;draftyear=2012&amp;genpos=DE"><span class="s1">keep him from being drafted</span></a>.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Undrafted free agent, signs with Jacksonville Jaguars</i></p><p class="p1">Jacksonville will be looking for pass rushers at No. 7 overall in this draft, but having a coachable backup who has, at times, shown the ability to get to the quarterback would bolster their defensive line rotation as well.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>JORDAN MABIN, Cornerback</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Despite being burned on occasion at Northwestern by NFL-caliber receivers like Illinois&rsquo;s A.J. Jenkins, Mabin demonstrated sufficient physical skills and natural ability to earn a shot in the NFL some day. Unfortunately, the previously sturdy cornerback tore a pectoral muscle in Northwestern&rsquo;s regular season finale against Michigan State, and is still not at full strength &ndash; he ran a 4.52-second 40-yard dash at a belated pro day in late March. His injury will keep him from being drafted, and he may have to work out for teams once he reaches full strength just to perk interest as a free agent.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Undrafted free agent, signs with Carolina Panthers later in offseason</i></p><p class="p1">In a division with excellent quarterbacks and dangerous receivers, Carolina could always use extra bodies at cornerback to play in nickel and dime packages. If Mabin can show the Panthers he&rsquo;s healthy, they could offer him a shot.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><b>BRIAN PETERS, Safety</b></p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1">Peters may be the most difficult of the Northwestern prospects to predict. He is an excellent physical safety, measuring 6&rsquo;3&rdquo; and weighing 215 lbs., and he jumped well at his pro day (32 1/2 inches). Still, he doesn&rsquo;t have fantastic speed &ndash; he ran in the 4.6 range in the 40-yard dash &ndash; and he comes from Northwestern&rsquo;s leaky pass defense that couldn&rsquo;t stop anyone last season. But with the size to cover tight ends and good character in the locker room, a team could jump on Peters in one of the later rounds. If not, he should have <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1096793-northwestern-wildcats-brian-peters-leaves-pro-day-impressing-nfl-scouts"><span class="s1">plenty of suitors</span></a> in undrafted free agency.</p><p class="p2"></p><p class="p1"><i>Prediction: Undrafted free agent, signs with Denver Broncos</i></p><p class="p1">With Brian Dawkins retired and last year&rsquo;s second round pick Rahim Moore afraid to tackle anyone, Denver could use a physical safety who is smart enough to stay disciplined in coverage.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
