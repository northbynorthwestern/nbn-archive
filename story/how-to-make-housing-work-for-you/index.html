It could be. There are still apartments available in Evanston. Photo by the author.</div><p>Housing  blues got you down? Whether you&#8217;re stuck in the dorm from hell or just so lazy you never got around to signing up for housing at all, you&#8217;re  not out of luck &#8212; there are still rooms available on campus. And if you&#8217;re  ready to move out of the meal plan-mandated dormitories, it&#8217;s not too late to snag a place in Evanston.</p><p><strong>What&#8217;s the story on dorms?</strong></p><p>Every  student who applied for a priority number had the chance to reserve  a room on campus for the 2008-2009 school year, according to Undergraduate Housing Associate Director Mark D&#8217;Arienzo.</p><p>While some freshmen have complained that dorms filled up faster this year than in the past,  D&#8217;Arienzo said about the same number of students sought on-campus housing this year as did last year. The only difference this time, he said, was that fewer rising sophomores registered for housing, while more of next year&#8217;s juniors and seniors expressed interest.</p><p>Although no students were turned away from on-campus housing entirely, some students with high priority numbers were less than thrilled with the dorm options  left for them. McCormick freshman Sloane McNulty said she wanted to  live in Bobb Hall or McCulloch Hall, but she resorted to choosing a room  in Sargent when the first two filled up before her selection time.   McNulty&#8217;s priority number was 1736.</p><p>&#8220;I  wanted to live in Bobb with all of my friends,&#8221; McNulty said. &#8220;But  by the time it was my turn, Sargent was one of the only dorms left on  North Campus.&#8221;</p><p>McNulty  requested to be on the wait lists for Bobb and McCulloch minutes after  the housing contracts were distributed via e-mail.</p><p><strong>What are the chances of getting  in off the wait list?</strong></p><p>According  to D&#8217;Arienzo, McNulty and other students on dorm wait lists shouldn&#8217;t  be too concerned. It&#8217;s not like a college wait list; people <em>do </em> get into residence halls by placing themselves on these lists. In fact,  D&#8217;Arienzo said every student with a &#8220;feasible&#8221; waitlist request  last year was satisfied. He defines feasible requests as those seeking  a room that exists on campus.</p><p>&#8220;If  they were asking for a single in Allison, it didn&#8217;t happen because  there&#8217;s no such thing,&#8221; D&#8217;Arienzo said. &#8220;Other than those impossible  requests, if students applied to be on the waitlist at the time they  signed their contracts, they all got in.&#8221;</p><p><strong>What if you never registered for a priority number but still want to live in a residence hall?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s  not too late to get a room on campus, even if you skipped the room selection  process the first time around. Although Northwestern doesn&#8217;t guarantee students housing past freshman year, there are still  spots available. D&#8217;Arienzo said there are singles open in Foster-Walker and a small number of rooms in other residence halls around  campus. GREEN House (Group Residence for Environmental Engagement at  Northwestern), the new environmentally-themed living community, also  has eight spots left for upperclassmen, according to Green House Co-Founder  Jackie Beard. Most of the more popular dorms, though, like Allison, Bobb, McCulloch, Willard and Kemper, are already full.</p><p>Students still looking to reserve a room on campus should contact the Undergraduate  Housing Office at <a href="mailto:housing@northwestern.edu" target="_blank">housing@northwestern.edu</a>.</p><p><strong>Why doesn&#8217;t Northwestern guarantee housing to upperclassmen?</strong></p><p>Even  without an official housing guarantee, D&#8217;Arienzo said the school has  never turned away any student looking for on-campus housing. According to him,  Northwestern hasn&#8217;t considered a four-year housing guarantee because  it would be unrealistic to assume that every student would want to live on  campus for all four years.</p><p>&#8220;We  can&#8217;t guarantee housing because that implies we have one bed for every  one of the 8000 undergraduates registered,&#8221; D&#8217;Arienzo said.</p><p><strong>What about off campus living?</strong></p><p>For  those students who have had enough of hairy showers, signing in guests  and the double-occupancy rule, there&#8217;s still time to find an oasis  beyond Northwestern&#8217;s grounds.  There are a number of free real estate  agencies serving the Evanston area, such as <a href="http://www.nsapts.com/shermannoyes.html">North Shore Apartments &#038; Condos, Inc</a>., as well as online resources  like the <a href="http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/classifieds/">classified ads</a> on the Daily Northwestern&#8217;s web site and <a href="http://chicago.craigslist.org/search/apa?query=evanston&amp;minAsk=min&amp;maxAsk=max&amp;bedrooms=)">Craigslist</a>.</p><p>Although students began signing leases for off-campus houses and apartments  as early as January, some apartments are still available in off-campus  buildings popular among Northwestern students, according to  North Shore Apartments &#038; Condos Managing Broker Andy Scott. Scott  said open apartments exist in buildings at Sherman and Noyes, Simpson and Ridge, and Maple and Noyes. Many downtown apartments are also still on the market. Some of these available off-campus abodes may even be good finds; Scott called the apartments at Simpson and Ridge &#8220;huge,&#8221; but said they usually rent for the same or less than those in the other two buildings. </p><p> &#8220;The apartments at Simpson and Ridge have lots of space, but they  are a couple of blocks further away from campus so they&#8217;re around  the same prices as smaller apartments closer to Northwestern,&#8221; Scott  said.</p><p>Rent  varies from building to building, but many of the apartments available  from North Shore Apartments &#038; Condos or listed on Craigslist have a monthly rent of about $1100 for one bedroom, $1500 for two bedrooms and $2000 for three bedrooms. As a rule of thumb, Scott said the apartments closer  to campus are more expensive, but that prices reflect everything  from size to location to furnishing.</p><p>If  you&#8217;re still looking for a place for the &#8216;08-&#8217;09 school year, Scott  said to call North Shore Apartments &#038; Condos at (847) 491-9039 with a price range and an idea of where you&#8217;d like to be located. </p><p>A word of warning, though:  Be prepared to sign a 12-month lease when renting an Evanston apartment.  This means that if you plan to leave Northwestern over the summer, you&#8217;ll  have to find someone to sublet or you&#8217;ll be stuck with the bill from an empty apartment!</p><p><strong><div style="text-align-center">Monthly rates for apartments still available through North Shore Apartments &#038; Condos</div><p></strong></p><p><a name="11a0e8b079dc46a7_0.1_table01" ></a></p><div><table border="2" cellspacing="0" width="0" align="center"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="25%" height="13"></td><td width="24%">1 Bedroom</td><td width="24%">2 Bedrooms</td><td width="24%">3 Bedrooms</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td height="14">Sherman/Noyes</td><td>$1075-1250</td><td>$1525-1650</td><td>$2200-2350</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td height="13">Simpson/Ridge</td><td>$1075-1200</td><td>$1395-1425</td><td>$1995</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td height="14">Maple/Noyes</td><td>$1095-1150</td><td>$1250-1425</td><td>n/a</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
