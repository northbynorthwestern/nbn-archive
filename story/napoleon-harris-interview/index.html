During his junior season as a Wildcat, the team won their most recent Big Ten Championship.</em><br /><br /><em>He followed his Northwestern career with a seven-year term in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders, Minnesota Vikings and Kansas City Chiefs before transitioning into a career in business and politics.</em><br /><br /><em>The native of Dixmoor, Ill., 33, owns multiple locations of the Beggar&rsquo;s Pizza franchise that originated on the South Side of Chicago. He's also running unopposed as the Democratic candidate for the Illinois State Senate in the 15th District.</em><br /><br /><em>Harris served as an honorary captain for Northwestern last Saturday against Indiana when the Wildcats moved to 5-0. Prior to the game, NBN Sports caught up with Harris to get his thoughts on his political career, the benefits of playing football and who he considers to be the greatest linebacker in Northwestern history.</em><br /><strong></strong></p><div style="width: 250px; float: right; margin-left: 15px;"><img src="../../media/uploads/2012/10/01/Napoleon_Harris.jpg" /><div class="caption">Former NFL linebacker and aspiring politician Napoleon Harris chats with NU President Morton Schapiro. Photo by Sunny Lee / North By Northwestern</div></div><p><strong>Did playing football here at Northwestern help prepare you for the transition into politics you&rsquo;re going through now?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>Tremendously. Northwestern has surrounded me with a culture that&rsquo;s second to none. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of great people here at this institution. A lot of smart people. A lot of people that you build relationships with. And Northwestern, the football aspect of it, taught me a lot about teamwork, determination, staying the course. And those things are so true to life and politics. Politics, you have to work well with other legislators, so that&rsquo;s teamwork. You have to be determined and never give up because something you might want to pass or may want to get through is not going to happen the first time around because of the number of votes (needed). But you have to stay diligent, persevere on the course and great things will happen as long as you work hard and stay at it.<strong></strong><br /><br /><strong></strong><strong>Why was it important to you to serve your area as a politician?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong> I think for me, it was more so&mdash;the area I was born and raised in&mdash;it was an opportunity for me to reinvest in that area and give back, so to speak, and to help that area become prosperous, as it used to be.<br /><br />We have a lot of tough times going on in that area and I just wanted to be a part of the solution to put those building blocks together&mdash;to get the economy going back in that area, to get the communities cleaned up and bring positive change in that area.<br /><br /><strong>How has it changed since you grew up there, if it has changed at all?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>Prior to when I was younger, you had a lot of factory jobs. You had a lot of blue collar. But over time, the economy and different conditions that influence the area turned it into a very impoverished area with a lot of dormant buildings. I want to be part of the process to bring jobs back to the area, to increase the pride in the area, increase the educational outlook on the area and just overall make it a better community to live in.<br /><br /><strong>Were you able to stay there while you were in the NFL?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>Yes, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s exciting to me. Growing up in the area, playing in the NFL, and then opening up a business&mdash;I&rsquo;m a small business owner&mdash;my business is right in the area as well. The only time I ever left (the area) was to go to another state to play football. I take a lot of pride in that. It&rsquo;s really special to me to come back and serve in that capacity.<br /><br /><strong>When did you get involved with your business?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>I did actually when I was still playing in the NFL. It&rsquo;s a franchise called Beggar&rsquo;s Pizza. I love the pizza. It&rsquo;s a South Side tradition. Every time I came home off a plane, or any time come home to Chicago, I stopped off at Beggar&rsquo;s to get me a pizza before I go home. And I told my brother one day, &ldquo;Man, I should just buy the place (since) I spend so much money there.&rdquo; I love the product, so I said, "What better way to serve my community than to put a business to create jobs and opportunities for people to come work?"</p><p><strong>Since you're running unopposed for the state senate seat, what is your schedule like?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>The schedule right now is meetings, meetings and more meetings. I&rsquo;m trying to put together a few fundraisers and still register people to vote and educate the voters on different issues in my district, as well as the state of Illinois.</p><p><strong>Will you be in Springfield full-time or commute back and forth from home?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>It will be a commute back and forth. I will probably have an apartment or some place to rent to stay over but for the most part, it will be a commute.<strong></strong><br /><br /><strong>You were a first round draft pick in the NFL (selected 23rd overall in 2002), so it was clear you were going to have a career there. Did you also have the dream early on of going into politics at some point, in the way that some dream about playing in the NFL?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong> I did. I didn&rsquo;t realize how much hard work it is, going out campaigning, fundraising, going out and actually having to ask each individual for their vote. That&rsquo;s the tough part that everyone doesn&rsquo;t see on a day-to-day basis. They see the speeches, they see the people on TV talking issues, but they don&rsquo;t see the hard work behind the scenes. The time away from your family and the sacrifice that you give up with actually running a campaign.<br /><br /><strong>How does that compare with the sacrifice of playing in the NFL?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>Quite frankly, there are a lot of parallels. You sacrifice in the NFL because of the time away on the road playing games, long practice hours, watching film, staying behind late to work on your craft. And it&rsquo;s no different in politics. You have to stay abreast on the issues, meet with different policy makers and lobbyists to get informed on certain topics and then sit down and debrief yourself to figure out what&rsquo;s the best solution for your constituents. It&rsquo;s mentally demanding.<strong></strong><br /><br /><strong>When your career ended, were you ready for it to be over, or was that an adjustment?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>It was somewhat of an adjustment. I wasn&rsquo;t quite ready. I thought I definitely could play five or six more years. And even now, today, physically, if someone needed a linebacker, I could play. I&rsquo;m in shape (and) I know defense like the back of my hand. I could physically play but I think my life has a bigger calling right now.<br /><br /><strong>Do you think there are still tangible benefits from playing football? There is a lot of talk right now about whether football is good for people, with all the injuries and new information coming out about concussions.</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>I think it is. Football is definitely made me that much mentally tougher because the ebbs and flow are like a roller coaster. There are highs and lows. And that&rsquo;s in life. You&rsquo;re going to have good and bad in life. I think football in that respect has definitely done a lot for me because it taught me how to fight through the tough times. It really challenged my mental fortitude and kept me tough.<br /><br /><strong>Did you go through any particularly tough times during your NFL career?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>I would say the 2004 season. It was the first time I&rsquo;d ever been hurt at any particular time in my athletic career, in high school, college or pro. I sustained a knee injury and missed significant time. I had surgery and there was doubt about whether or not I could come back from it. I probably came back a little too early because I was pushing myself and was so determined to come back and I wasn&rsquo;t playing the way I know I was capable of playing.<br /><br /><strong>What do you think about the Northwestern football team this year? They're undefeated and the Big Ten is in a down year.</strong></p><p>A lot of people say the Big Ten is in a down year. I just think that Northwestern is in an up year. Northwestern has really made strides and I think Coach (Patrick) Fitzgerald has done a terrific job in making sure that he recruits the right type of guys to fit the program to bring about a winning tradition, as well as young men that are going to represent the institution well.<br /><br /><strong>How important is it to this school to get a bowl win? You were here during their last Big Ten championship (in 2000), so there has been a winning culture, but Northwestern hasn't won a bowl game since 1949.</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>I think that&rsquo;s the next major hurdle to put Northwestern football back into an &ldquo;elite level,&rdquo; as far as Big Ten football is concerned&mdash;it&rsquo;s accumulating bowl wins. I think once you get the first one, the confidence comes from the players and then you&rsquo;re able to get other recruits who believe that you can win.&nbsp; It becomes a snowball effect.<br /><br /><strong>Who is the best linebacker in Northwestern history?</strong><br /><br /><strong></strong>Oh, that&rsquo;s tough. The best linebacker in Northwestern history? (pauses) I would have to say, with all the accolades, Coach Fitzgerald is definitely the most decorated linebacker that we have so I would have to say Coach Fitzgerald because he has all the hardware. But I like to think that I was a pretty good linebacker and that I could hold my own versus anybody.<strong></strong></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
