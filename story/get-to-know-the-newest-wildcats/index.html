Five players each hail from Illinois and Ohio, while three come from Texas and California. With two early decision walk-ons bringing the total of newbies to 21, NBN Sports breaks down what each new 'Cat has to offer.</p><p><strong><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Matt-Alviti-112407">Matt Alviti</a></strong><br /><em>Quarterback,&nbsp;</em><em>Park Ridge, Ill.</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 6</em></p><p>Alviti is the gem of the incoming class. At 6 feet tall, he is somewhat short for the position, but Kain Colter has shown that it&rsquo;s definitely possible to thrive while undersized. Like Colter, he has terrific athleticism and the ability to keep plays alive.</p><p>With Colter and sophomore Trevor Siemian returning at quarterback, it&rsquo;s unlikely that we&rsquo;ll see Alviti next year, but he is considered the future of Wildcats football. Expect big things from the dual-threat down the road.</p><p><strong><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Sam-Coverdale-136813">Sam Coverdale</a></strong><br /><em>Offensive Lineman,&nbsp;</em><em>Chagrin Falls, Ohio</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 42</em></p><p>The 6-foot-7 Coverdale has very good athleticism for a player his size, but he needs to improve his initial explosion. He has good upper body and hand strength, and his intensity makes him a highly-regarded run blocker.</p><p>With the loss of senior Patrick Ward at left tackle, Coverdale is a candidate to earn a spot in the starting lineup this season.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Tommy-Fuessel-138554"><strong>Tommy Fuessel</strong></a><br /><em>Wide Receiver, Mokena, Ill. </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>Fuessel was a quarterback in high school, but he is projected as a wideout for the 'Cats. He can change direction well and make defenders miss in the open field, but he needs to improve his strength to compete on the next level. In all likelihood, we won&rsquo;t see him on the field next year.</p><p><strong><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Matt-Harris-137570">Matthew Harris</a></strong><br /><em>Cornerback, LaGrange Highlands, Ill.</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 21</em></p><p>With his good size, Harris has potential at many positions, as he was a wide receiver, defensive end and special teams player in high school. He could possibly contribute, but it is probable that he will redshirt next year.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/northwestern/football/recruiting/player-Godwin-Igwebuike-131180"><strong>Godwin Igwebuike</strong></a><br /><em>Running Back, Pickerington, Ohio </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 28</em></p><p>The talented Igwebuike fielded offers from several other Big Ten schools, including Michigan State, Nebraska and Wisconsin. He has been described as a total player who could also be put at wide receiver or safety.</p><p>Senior Tyris Jones is gone, so look for Igwebuike to step in and get some carries in his first year.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Eric-Joraskie-136893"><strong>Eric Joraskie</strong></a><br /><em>Defensive Tackle, Mount Carmel, Pa. </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 29</em></p><p>Joraskie has played as a defensive end, but his size will probably elicit a change to tackle. He will have to put on more weight, but he has the skills to compete right away.</p><p>The &lsquo;Cats are losing defensive linemen Brian Arnfelt and Quentin Williams, who combined for 7.5 sacks a year ago, so Joraskie may be called upon early.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Blake-King-133994"><strong>Blake King</strong></a><br /><em>Offensive Lineman, Shorewood, Ill.</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 32</em></p><p>King has the size to be very good once he puts on a bit more weight. His initial burst of speed makes him a good run blocker, and he is athletic for a player his size.</p><p>King has the challenge of fighting for a starting spot at tackle next year, much like Coverdale.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Tyler-Lancaster-132599"><strong>Tyler Lancaster</strong></a><br /><em>Defensive Tackle, Plainfield, Ill. </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 16</em></p><p>Lancaster was the No. 6 center recruit in the class of 2013 according to Rivals, but he will most likely be moved to the defense because of his combination of strength and quickness.</p><p>The 6-foot-4 Lancaster is another guy who could possibly earn some playing time as a true freshman.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Warren%20Miles-Long-131356"><strong>Warren Long</strong></a><br /><em>Running Back, Union City, Calif. </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>At 6 feet and 200 pounds, Long is big for a running back, but he has deceptive speed for a player his size. While he has the potential to be a force in the future, we probably will not see him next year.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Marcus-McShepard-144945"><strong>Marcus McShepard</strong></a><br /><em> Cornerback, University Heights, Ohio</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 49</em></p><p>McShepard has good size and the ability to make a big play downfield, and he also has shown skills as a return man. He will most likely redshirt the upcoming season.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Xavier-Menifield-139440"><strong>Xavier Menifield</strong></a><br /><em> Running Back, Valencia, Calif. </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>Menifield is a well-rounded player with solid rushing and receiving ability. He is an athletic back with a small frame, and he has great speed, but is unlikely that he will play next year.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Hunter-Niswander-142155"><strong>Hunter Niswander</strong></a><br /><em>Kicker/Punter, Peninsula, Ohio</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>The 6-foot-5 Niswander has good potential at both kicker and punter, and scouts say that he has a smooth stroke. With the Wildcats&rsquo; wealth at both positions, he will probably redshirt.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Brad-North-138367"><strong>Brad North</strong></a><br /><em>Offensive Lineman, Allen, Texas </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>North played a lot of tackle in high school, but he may be better suited as a guard with his size and athleticism. He is highly skilled, but with Northwestern&rsquo;s depth on the offensive line, it&rsquo;s unclear whether or not we will see him next year.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Kyle-Queiro-129314"><strong>Kyle Queiro</strong></a><br /><em>Cornerback, Verona, N.J.</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 17</em></p><p>Queiro is nationally-ranked safety who will be switching to corner for NU. He received offers from other Big Ten schools like Penn State and recorded four picks and five receiving touchdowns in his senior season.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/northwestern/football/recruiting/player-Jayme-Taylor-132236"><strong>Jayme Taylor</strong></a><br /><em>Superback, The Woodlands, Texas</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>A receiver and quarterback in high school, Taylor is a versatile athlete and has good size and strength for a player at his position. He will probably redshirt this upcoming season.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Anthony-Walker%20Jr.-129252"><strong>Anthony Walker Jr.</strong></a><br /><em>Safety, Miami, Fla.</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>Walker played at both wide receiver and linebacker in high school, but he is projected as a safety for the 'Cats. He has good size and athleticism to be a contributor in the future, but he will most likely sit out next year.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Brett-Walsh-139244"><strong>Brett Walsh</strong></a><br /><em>Safety, Monrovia, Calif. </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>Projected by many recruiting sites as an outside linebacker, the 'Cats see Walsh becoming a contributor as a safety. He is a smart player with good instincts, which could allow him to help his team out early.</p><p>Though relatively unheralded, Walsh could potentially help out the Wildcat defense next season.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Keith-Watkins-133265"><strong>Keith Watkins II</strong></a><br /><em>Running Back, Cincinnati, Ohio</em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: 24</em></p><p>Watkins has the well-rounded skill set of a multi-purpose 'back. Although he doesn&rsquo;t have the speed of some players ranked above him, he still could contribute right away.</p><p>Look for him to step in as a third-down back and give the 'Cats some vital yards in 2013.</p><p><a href="http://rivals.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-Macan-Wilson-132248"><strong>Macan Wilson</strong></a><br /><em>Wide Receiver, Houston, Texas </em><br /><em>Rivals State Ranking: NR</em></p><p>Wilson doesn&rsquo;t have great height to be a receiver at the college level, but he makes up for it with toughness and smarts. Don't expect to see much of him next year, though.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
