While Barakat has lived in Qatar her whole life, she was born in Syria, and has family and friends who still live there. Having spent two quarters in Evanston last year, Barakat saw the Syrian civil war unfold from both America and Qatar, giving her a wider perspective on the situation.</em><em>&nbsp;Speaking with North by Northwestern,&nbsp;</em><em>Barakat</em><em>&nbsp;discussed her experiences as a Northwestern undergraduate as they relate to her views on Syria, as well as her experiences as an international student who encounters multiple cultural perspectives.</em></p><p><strong>1) As an international student with many options, why did you choose Northwestern, both in Qatar and as your study abroad option?</strong></p><p>I went to Northwestern University in Qatar because it was the best option between what is offered in Qatar, for me at least ... and my parents prefer if I stayed at the same country with them. As for being international student at NU-E, I just spent two quarters (Winter and Spring) during my junior year. I went there because it is easier to transfer credit, and I visited the campus during my freshman year and fell in love with the place. Plus, my aunt and uncle have lived in Chicago for years now, so I wasn&rsquo;t completely alone there.</p><p><strong>2) What do you think of NU's approach to global affairs and cultural differences?</strong></p><p>I think NU is doing its best considering circumstances, but there is always space for improvement. During my stay there, there were some cultural events, but they were mainly targeted [at], or about, [the] Latino community and sometimes Asians. I didn&rsquo;t find much diversity, but I think this is the case in every campus and every country. However, I wish students there knew more about Qatar and the region, especially that they have a campus there. The media tends to show only narrow aspects and stereotypes of Middle East, so Northwestern, being a prestigious university, should be better than that.</p><p><strong>3) How do discussions of international affairs with professors and students differ at NU Qatar vs. Northwestern in Evanston?</strong></p><p>Due to Qatar&rsquo;s nature, numbers of non-Qataris are more than Qataris in the country. It is a very diverse place, more diverse than NU-E, so international and cultural topics are pretty interesting in NU-Q because you get different perspectives. Also, when it comes to issues of war, NU-Q students tend to speak out of real life experience since the region has always been in trouble. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still enjoyed discussions that I had in NU-E &ndash; especially that many times professors would discuss topics that feel forbidden to me.</p><p><strong>4) As a Syrian citizen, how did you react when you heard about Syria's use of chemical weapons? Were you surprised, or was the violence something you were already aware of?</strong></p><p>I was really frustrated, but wasn&rsquo;t surprised. Syria has a history of unjustified violence against civilians, hence Hama massacre 1982, which was even uglier. The only difference is that the gassing incident had an international interference, and media in the equation. I just hope that that was the climax of the whole Syria conflict so we can actually start fixing the situation.</p><p><strong>5) How did you feel about the international response, particularly by America's proposal of a limited airstrike?</strong></p><p>I think it wasn&rsquo;t efficient enough. I&rsquo;m mostly disappointed that neighboring countries did not do anything practical. International interference is what made Syria&rsquo;s situation worse. However, the USA responded, although it might sound radical for many people, but it is right at this time. Plus, from what I heard, the USA were targeting specific areas that will not harm civilians, and personally I know many Syrians who were pro USA response.</p><p><strong>6) Did your experience as a student in the U.S. influence your perspective on the response?</strong></p><p>I learned how American politics is much more collective than I thought, particularly when compared to politics in most Arab countries, where most dissensions are not voted on, and generated by many people, if that makes sense. So when USA made that decision, I knew it was not an easy, quick one. I also believe in Obama and think he is a good man with right intentions, and if I was a U.S. citizen, I would have even voted for him.</p><p><strong>7) At NU Qatar, what is the general consensus on this issue? Due to its location in the Middle East and differing student body composition, would you say the reaction there is unique from those at the Evanston campus?</strong></p><p>I wasn&rsquo;t in Evanston when this happened so I can&rsquo;t really compare, but we discussed it in classes very briefly, it was more discussed between students, and I know some NU-Q students who helped in the whole Syrian situation personally, some even went there to help during their break. I think it is just scary how almost everywhere outside Qatar is dangerous now and it is so close. But as much as it makes you scared and concerned, it also makes you thankful for every normal, safe day you live.</p><p><strong>8) How do you feel the situation in Syria will develop going forward?</strong></p><p>I try to be optimistic, but reality is different. I think it will get worse, but not for long. However, Syria is never going to be the same, and rebuilding it will take at least 20 years.</p><p><strong>9) How do your family and friends in Syria feel about the situation and how it may develop?</strong></p><p>My friends and family &ndash; &nbsp;there are three groups, one who just went to another country, mostly Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. The other group keeps thinking it is going to get better soon, but they have been saying that for the past year or more, putting their schooling and work at hold. The third group realized the situation is not going to be fixed anytime soon, so they just try to live day by day, still working and socializing. What is funny is, there is not a defined &ldquo;enemy&rdquo; in Syria now. People who live there experienced destruction from the regime, resistant groups and random people who took advantage of the chaotic situation and stole, and killed, then blamed the regime for their actions.</p><p><strong>10) Is there anything else you would like to add?</strong></p><p>My thoughts and beliefs stays humble, I tried to answer them honestly, but at the end of the day politics is not my specialty and I&rsquo;m sure no one knows everything, especially when it comes to matters like this. And many Syrians don&rsquo;t accept my opinion, or anyone&rsquo;s who lives outside Syria. Their excuse is, "You are not living it like I do." I also call for humanitarian aid, even more than political one, because normal citizens are the main victims in here.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
