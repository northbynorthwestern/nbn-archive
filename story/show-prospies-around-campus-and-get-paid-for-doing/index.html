Garson, however, reapplied his sophomore year and was lucky enough to be one of the few selected for the position.</p><p>Garson loves his job and is trying to fit in as many tours as he can before leaving Northwestern, giving as many as five to six per week.</p><p>“I love seeing campus through the eyes of someone who has never been here before. [Northwestern students] seem to forget how beautiful the buildings are and the lake is, or all of the great things Northwestern has to offer. I get to see the cool things I’ve done and things I have left to do,” he says.</p><p>Applications for becoming a tour guide went live on April 8th, and applications are rolling in, with more than 30 already received, according to Caitlin Smith, assistant director of Undergraduate Admission. While money may not be the main draw for students, it certainly helps &#8212; tour guides get paid eight dollars an hour and the job is one of the few on campus open to non work-study students. Those interested in applying can find a link to the application on either the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/group.php?gid=110931758929284&amp;ref=search&amp;sid=1164540239.2188671277..1">Facebook page</a> or the <a href="http://www.ugadm.northwestern.edu/current/tour-guides.htm">Office of Undergraduate Admissions website</a>. After submitting an application, all candidates come in for a group interview with five to seven other students.</p><p>“Just like college admissions, there is no &#8216;perfect&#8217; or &#8216;ideal&#8217; type of person we are looking for. We really are looking for students who are involved in all different types of activities on campus and with different majors,” Smith says. “However, some of the common qualities we look for are an ability to speak in front of people and an ability to answer questions honestly, but at the same time be enthusiastic about Northwestern.&#8221;</p><div class="quote_box">Many current tour guides say they applied because they wanted to show prospective students their level of excitement about the university.</div><p>Many current tour guides say they applied because they wanted to show prospective students their level of excitement about the university.</p><p>“I am passionate about this school and I wanted to share that, and I think that with a school like Northwestern there are a lot student-oriented things that you aren’t able to get from the school brochures or information sessions,” says Sean Brennan, a School of Communication sophomore.</p><p>School of Communication sophomore Meredith Dawson, a current tour guide, was encouraged by her friends to apply.</p><p>“A couple of my friends suggested that I apply because I am loud and energetic. Those who want to apply need to be enthusiastic,” says Dawson. “We want people who love this school and want to share it with others.”</p><p>Those students lucky enough to be accepted are given a manual full of fun facts and the history of the university. Guides memorize as many facts as they can and take a quiz on them. They also shadow a few tours and give a tour with a veteran guide observing. While the training may seem intense, current guides say it’s not scary.</p><p>“As long as you read the manual, you will do fine on the quiz,” says Cami Jones, a SESP sophomore.</p><p>Garson warns prospective guides to be flexible and willing to learn about aspects of Northwestern that they may not be involved in, such as Greek life or Dance Marathon.</p><p>“Those who just want to hold the name tag and have that power should not apply,” Garson says. “You also have to accept that you are going to meet people who want different things out of college than you and you have to be willing to answer their questions honestly.”</p><div class="quote_box">“Those who just want to hold the name tag and have that power should not apply,” Garson says.</div><p>Tour guides are seemingly obsessed with their jobs. It’s hard to find one who has something negative to say about being a guide. When prodded, though, they usually mention giving tours in miserable weather.</p><p>Brennan says, “You have to give tours in rain or snow, which isn’t too fun.”</p><p>Being a tour guide may seem like a huge time commitment. Tours do go out almost every day, sometimes two or three times a day. However, there is no set number of tours a guide has to give per week. Garson, for example, only gave two tours during winter quarter of his junior year. This quarter Brennan is giving three to four tours a week while Dawson is giving two per month.</p><p>Brennan says, “Tour times are limited to 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and sometimes noon, so there aren’t as many opportunities if you have class during one of those times.”</p><p>Don’t think, though, that being a tour guide is all work and no fun. Dawson says that the tour guide program is trying to set up some more social events this quarter to allow for guides to get to know one another.</p><p>“I’ve met a lot of great people so far while being a guide. We have some fun stuff planned for initiation, and we are trying to set up more social events for guides.”</p><p>So for those who say they bleed purple and can’t get enough of what Northwestern has to offer, be sure to apply by April 28, but be prepared for tough competition.</p><p>“I take pride in [the fact that only eight percent are accepted],” Garson says.  “I think it’s really cool that there are hundreds of Northwestern students on campus who want to take time out of their day to show prospective students what Northwestern is like and talk about their experiences here.”</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
