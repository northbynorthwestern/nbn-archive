Photo by Katie Tang / North By Northwestern</div><p>After being torn apart by Army quarterback Trent Steelman, it has become clear that the Wildcats&rsquo; run defense is vulnerable to mobile quarterbacks. Army, which hadn&rsquo;t held a lead all season until the Northwestern game, racked up 381 rushing yards against the &lsquo;Cats, including 108 yards and three touchdowns for Steelman.</p><p>The worst part? Steelman was just the first of several running quarterbacks Northwestern will have to face this season. Although Steelman is slightly different because he runs a triple-option offense, it is clear that Northwestern could have a difficult time with mobile quarterbacks, bad news for a team trying to contend in the Big Ten, where the conference&rsquo;s leading three rushers currently are all quarterbacks. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the top scrambling Big Ten quarterbacks that Northwestern will face this season:</p><p><strong>Nathan Scheelhaase, Illinois: </strong>While he certainly has the toughest name to pronounce, Scheelhaase (pronounced &ldquo;Sheel-house&rdquo;) is the least dangerous of the three rushing quarterbacks the &lsquo;Cats will face during Big Ten season. Scheelhaase has rushed for only 184 yards in three games this year, although he put up 93 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a Week Two rout against South Dakota State. The Illini quarterback can certainly run the ball effectively, as he put together solid rushing numbers (868 yards and five touchdowns) last year. Against Northwestern at Wrigley Field, Scheelhaase did not throw well (only six completions for 40 yards with one touchdown and one interception), but he ran the ball very well, totaling 97 yards on 19 carries. The Illini (3-0) are NU&rsquo;s next opponent, but they are a team the &lsquo;Cats can handle. Scheelhaase should be a good first test of how Northwestern will deal with more traditional mobile quarterbacks throughout the season.</p><p><strong>Denard Robinson, Michigan: </strong>The Heisman candidate Robinson is lethally fast, puts up video-game numbers and can throw the ball well in crunch time (just watch his highlights against Notre Dame below). The junior threw for 338 yards and four touchdowns in Week Two against Notre Dame, but still managed to pick up 108 yards on the ground and tack on another touchdown. Robinson showed no mercy in rushing for 198 yards and a touchdown last week against Eastern Michigan while leading the Wolverines to a 31-3 victory, keeping the Wolverines undefeated. Robinson&rsquo;s play was spectacular last year, as he amassed 1700 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground, hitting the 100-yard plateau in nine games. He comes to Ryan Field on Oct. 8, and the &lsquo;Cats could be hard-pressed to find a way to stop the dual-threat quarterback. Not many defenses can say they have.</p><p><strong>Edward Wright-Baker, Indiana: </strong>Picked to start for the Hoosiers less than a week before their first game, Wright-Baker has played pretty well so far this season &ndash; tossing four touchdowns and only one interception &ndash; but is certainly someone the &lsquo;Cats should be able to contain. Wright-Baker is still primarily a passer, as he only has rushed for 101 yards so far this entire season, but has had double-digit carry totals in all three games. He played his best overall game of the season last week against South Carolina State, when he complimented his 272 passing yards and two touchdowns with 41 rushing yards on 10 carries. The &lsquo;Cats play in Bloomington on Oct. 29 and will likely be favored, but they will still have to worry about stopping Wright-Baker both through the air and on the ground. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>Taylor Martinez, Nebraska:</strong> Martinez, a sophomore, has had a monster start to his season, leading the Cornhuskers to a 3-0 start. Unlike Steelman, Martinez has actually hit double-digit completions in every game (Steelman completed just one 6-yard pass against NU), so the Northwestern defense will have to worry about his running and passing abilities. But he has done the majority of his damage on the ground, racking up 384 yards and 6 touchdowns so far, including his 166-yard, two-touchdown show against Fresno State in week two. He has had a fumbling problem (22 fumbles in 15 career games), but Steelman does as well and the &lsquo;Cats were unable to capitalize.&nbsp;And while Denard Robinson may get all the hype, Martinez is actually the quarterback leading the Big Ten in rushing so far this season. Martinez can wreak havoc on a defense, and Northwestern could be a perfect victim on Nov. 5.</p><p><strong>MarQueis Gray, Minnesota: </strong>Perhaps the most intriguing name on this list, Gray is a converted wide receiver with killer athleticism. But with only three weeks of experience at the position, Gray lacks the command of a seasoned quarterback. Gophers head coach Jerry Kill has said that <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/rapid-reports/post/15611912" target="_blank">the offense has been simplified</a> for Gray, and as the dynamic quarterback has gained experience, his play has improved. He was relatively ineffective in the team&rsquo;s opening loss against USC on the road, rushing for just 47 yards on 16 carries, but the next two weeks Gray eclipsed the century mark; in Minnesota&rsquo;s third game of the year, he exploded for 171 rushing yards on 25 carries to lead the Gophers to their first victory, a win against Miami of Ohio. However, so far this season Gray has not been much of a passing threat, only throwing for 468 yards and three touchdowns in three games. The &lsquo;Cats should be favored when they face the Gophers at home on Nov. 19, but if Gray becomes a better passer over the next couple months, while continuing to be a threat on the ground, the &lsquo;Cats could be in trouble. <strong></strong></p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
