The album, released in August of last year, has a title from Amish culture, song titles named after American cities, compositions that take inspiration from 20th century minimalism and a sound delivered by renowned Scandinavian groups Efterklang and Amiina, of Sigur R&oacute;s fame.</p><p>Nashville native Daniel James, the brains behind the moniker, has captured the eyes of critics nationwide with this unique mix. The result is a driving, forward-moving album similar to a journey, with each track offering different scenery yet still part of the same coherent picture, a concept not unlike the original creation of the album itself, written while James was on tour.</p><p>We caught up with James in December after a busy year of touring. Catch him <a href="http://www.schubas.com/Shows/01-12-2012+TNK+ST+Plants+and+Animals+" target="&quot;_blank">live at Schubas</a> with Plants and Animals on Thursday as part of <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/tomorrow-never-knows-tnk-2012-festival/page?oid=4959632" target="_blank">Tomorrow Never Knows fest</a><em>.</em><em></em></p><p><b><em>Rumspringa</em> was written in Copenhagen and recorded with <a href="http://efterklang.net/" target="_blank">Efterklang</a> in Iceland. That&rsquo;s really interesting. How did you meet Efterklang and how did this collaboration come about?</b><br /> I first started emailing with Casper [Clausen] from Efterklang probably six or seven years ago. When I originally recorded my first record I just did it by myself. I turned that to them just because I was a fan. They ended up liking it and they put it out on <a href="http://rumraket.com/shop/rumraket.html" target="_blank">their label</a>. Over the years we&rsquo;ve gotten to know each other and I started playing the guitar for them on a couple tours. I was working on the album while I was out with them so we kind of just naturally left it to them to produce it, recording in Copenhagen and Iceland.</p><p><b>How did the collaboration with <a href="http://amiina.com/" target="_blank">Amiina</a> (the string quartet who's worked extensively with Sigur R&oacute;s) come about?</b><br /> They did all the strings on the record, except for one song. Two of the members played with Efterklang right at the beginning, so they have been good friends for a long time. We contacted them through Efterklang and they were up for the project.</p><p><b>So how does your album translate to a live set?<b><br /></b></b>It&rsquo;s definitely different. We have a couple samplers and we definitely had to rearrange the songs and approach them in a different way, which I kind of like anyways. It kind of gives the songs new life, so you&rsquo;re not just regurgitating what you&rsquo;ve already done. It allows the songs to develop. It&rsquo;s just kind of more interesting, and I welcome the idea. But at the same time, it would be nice to have, you know, 12 people on stage to fully realize the album.</p><p><b>I can tell the album has some Efterklang influences, and Scandinavian orchestral influences in general. How did working in northern Europe influence your compositions?<b><br /></b></b>I grew up listening to a lot of Icelandic and Scandinavian music, so it just seemed like a very fitting place to record. Most of the songs are kind of written in the U.S., though. So I think, if anything, the influence came before, just because of the records I was listening to. Once I was there, everyone that played on the record for the most part was Danish or Icelandic, so they brought their own particular, I guess, Scandinavian-ish to the record.</p><p><b>But then you have U.S. cities as subtitles for your tracks. What&rsquo;s the meaning behind that, and how do these two dynamics of European influences and American namesakes work together?</b><br /> The city names come from when I was initially on tour. I decided to take a couple weeks and write a new idea every day, and whatever city I was in at the time when I wrote the idea is what I would name the song, just to keep track of them all. Once I got down the road and finished the lyrics, I kind of wanted to have a title that was attached to the themes of the song. But I also kind of liked it being grounded in the initial idea in the geography of where it started, so I just kept them in.</p><p><b>The title of the album, <em>Rumspringa</em>, is a term from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa" target="_blank">Amish community</a>. How is this connected to the album?</b><br /> I had this weird fascination with words. I have this long list of words I find interesting, or visually interesting, so [Rumspringa] was one of them. So I actually had the title before I even started writing the record. I got the title originally from watching a documentary called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n518iLqRekM" target="_blank"><em>Devil&rsquo;s Playground</em></a>, which is about the Amish community and the kids when they&rsquo;re turning 16 and 17. They&rsquo;re allowed to do whatever they want. I was drawn to the idea of these people who are brought up in a very restricted environment, then all of a sudden, overnight, they&rsquo;re kind of allowed to do whatever they want. I just thought that was a very interesting thing to explore, how that affects our nature. They&rsquo;re very extreme situations to be placed in, I think, and I think it brings about very interesting things in human dynamics. It&rsquo;s kind of just an abstraction on freedom and how it affects people.</p><p><b>I read that you have a lot of minimalist composers as influences, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYnAQ-lK74A" target="_blank">Steve Reich</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z3WOGyMP0U" target="_blank">Philip Glass</a>, and I&rsquo;m a huge fan of both. Can you elaborate on the influence of contemporary classical music on your own?</b><br /> Up to that point when they came to the forefront of music, I think a lot of people like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HypmW4Yd7SY" target="_blank">John Cage</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XfeWp2y1Lk" target="_blank">[Karlheinz] Stockhausen</a> were doing very interesting things, but they were very challenging to listen to. I think what Philip Glass and Steve Reich and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjR4QYsa9nE" target="_blank">Terry Riley</a> did was they were able to bring back melody for something to grab a hold of, but also do it in a new way with the rhythm and the syncopation and repetitiveness. Actually, I got to see [Reich's] <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU23LqQ6LY4" target="_blank">&ldquo;Music for 18 Musicians&rdquo;</a> in Ireland earlier this year [when Efterklang played for Reich's 75th birthday celebration], which was insane. It&rsquo;s like being put in a trance. It&rsquo;s kind of like a dance almost, because people were moving from instrument to instrument, they&rsquo;ll trade off. One guy is just playing two notes for 20 minutes, he looked miserable, but when you sum it all up together, it&rsquo;s very interesting. I&rsquo;m not directly trying to copy what they&rsquo;re doing, but I&rsquo;ve listened to it so much that I think it just comes out in my music.</p><p><b>Your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfjSlqyUAAk" target="_blank">video for "Bows &amp; Arrows (Vegas)"</a> has a very mystical, tribal feel to it. What was the inspiration behind that?</b><br /> I read a lot of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, these guys who did a lot of studies on mythology and psychology. The idea was more like a manifestation of the brain and the emotions and personifying them and acting out this idea of something in your personality having to die or having a ritual of death in order to move on to the next stage of life. It&rsquo;s kind of like a weird play representing the psychological process.</p><p><b>Finally, I noticed that your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Canon-Blue/28455937447?sk=info" target="_blank">Facebook biography</a> has got to be one of the most creative I&rsquo;ve seen. How did you come up with that?</b><br /> I&rsquo;ve had that for ages. I had a phase where there was a certain feeling I would get. Different types of film, like the technical type of film that was used in the 60s and the 50s that just created this weird feeling in me that I want to call joy or bliss or something. I started cataloguing everything that made me feel that way and kind of creating an environment of, if I could have all these things in one room, that would be my heaven, or my purest form of joy, I guess. So it&rsquo;s just like a catalogue of different things I enjoy that bring about that feeling in me.</p><p><b>Did you have those specific images in your head when you were composing <em>Rumspringa</em>?</b><br /> Probably not those specific ones, but I would have films going while I was working, just on silent. I have stuff all over my walls in my room and studio that kind of speak to those kinds of things. So it&rsquo;s not those specific things, but things very similar to that were probably around while I was working.</p><em>Catch Canon Blue this <a href="http://www.schubas.com/Shows/01-12-2012+TNK+ST+Plants+and+Animals+" target="_blank">Thursday, Jan. 12, at Schubas</a> as part of <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/tomorrow-never-knows-tnk-2012-festival/page?oid=4959632" target="_blank">Tomorrow Never Knows fest</a>, the Schubas/Lincoln Hall/Metro joint event spanning mid-January.
