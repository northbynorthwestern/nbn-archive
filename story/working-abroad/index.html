Some will bring their&nbsp;spouses and kids to Homecoming games, guest&nbsp;star at lectures or give standing ovations at&nbsp;Waa-Mu performances. Some may even come&nbsp;back and work for the university.</p><p class="p1">A total of 13,000 NU alumni are currently&nbsp;living and working abroad, 3,400 of whom&nbsp;graduated in the last five years. In recent years,&nbsp;the number of alumni abroad has increased&nbsp;rapidly, especially in Asia, according to Aspasia&nbsp;Apostolakis Miller, director of students,&nbsp;young alumni and career services at the John&nbsp;Evans Alumni Center.</p><p class="p1">Despite the anchoring nostalgia for their&nbsp;alma mater, alumni are increasingly locking&nbsp;their belongings in storage, confronting&nbsp;cultural and language barriers and purchasing&nbsp;one-way tickets to new homes overseas.</p><div class="sidebar"><p>Rather than waste away summer babysitting your neighbor&rsquo;s 4-year-olds or busing tables at a local restaurant, consider teaching English to a classroom of first graders in Thailand or working in a health clinic in England.

If you have a four-year degree and&nbsp;speak English fluently, you&rsquo;ve got a shot.</p><p class="p1">When the domestic job market wasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;yielding favorable results for Daniel Andreeff&nbsp;(WCAS &lsquo;11), he started to expand his scope. He&nbsp;had studied abroad at Oxford, but he wanted&nbsp;to encounter challenges an English-speaking&nbsp;country couldn&rsquo;t provide. So, he applied for an&nbsp;English teaching program in China.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I felt like if I was ever going to take a leap&nbsp;of faith and move to a country I had never visited&nbsp;and didn&rsquo;t speak the language, right after&nbsp;graduation would probably be the best time,&rdquo;&nbsp;Andreeff says. &ldquo;I felt like I would probably&nbsp;never be as open to completely new experiences&nbsp;or as able to pursue them ever again.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">Andreeff was sitting in Evanston&rsquo;s Unicorn&nbsp;Cafe with friends when he got a call from his&nbsp;teaching program, Princeton in Asia. In that&nbsp;moment, he went from clueless to certain&nbsp;about his post-graduation plans. Despite his&nbsp;limited knowledge of Mandarin and obligation&nbsp;to travel 7,000 miles away from home, Andreeff&nbsp;says he didn&rsquo;t hesitate. He was excited to&nbsp;do something &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo; after graduation.</p><p class="p1">Andreeff now teaches international relations&nbsp;theory and foreign policy to seniors and&nbsp;English to freshmen at China Foreign Affairs&nbsp;University in Beijing, and he says he views&nbsp;teaching abroad as something challenging&nbsp;to do in the interim. He says he thinks this&nbsp;experience will inform him in any work&nbsp;he does in the future.</p><p class="p1">Lindsey Henrikson, another&nbsp;Weinberg 2011 graduate, also&nbsp;teaches in China and is considering&nbsp;law school among future&nbsp;plans. After studying abroad&nbsp;in both Spain and Scotland&nbsp;during her Northwestern&nbsp;career, she decided to&nbsp;head to the Chinese village&nbsp;of Hechuan to teach&nbsp;English at the Pass College&nbsp;Chong Qing Technology&nbsp;and Business University.</p><p class="p1">In rural Hechuan, both&nbsp;Henrikson&rsquo;s apartment and&nbsp;school have limited electricity&nbsp;and no heat. Often, there&nbsp;are more students than chairs&nbsp;in her classroom. She devised her&nbsp;curriculum from scratch, and her administrators&nbsp;at her school have yet to sit in&nbsp;on one of her classes. However, her salary&nbsp;is more than double that of the Chinese&nbsp;teachers at her school. Although it converts to&nbsp;very little in U.S. dollars, with her $15 per week&nbsp;food budget, she says she eats at the nicest&nbsp;restaurants in town.</p><p class="p1">Henrikson&rsquo;s students, all just two years&nbsp;younger than she is, have shown her&nbsp;around China&rsquo;s numerous big cities&nbsp;and invited her into their homes. But&nbsp;without the &ldquo;American bubble&rdquo; support system&nbsp;that watched over her while she studied&nbsp;abroad, she says she has had to learn to be&nbsp;independent while adjusting to a new environment&nbsp;alone.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;My experience proves that you don&rsquo;t have&nbsp;to go get a nine-to-five office job right away,&rdquo;&nbsp;Henrikson says. &ldquo;Instead, I&rsquo;m learning about&nbsp;myself and learning about the world.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">In the fall, she will head back to the States&nbsp;for law school, not forgetting the lessons she&nbsp;has learned, which she says in some ways have&nbsp;been more enriching than those she learned&nbsp;during her four years at Northwestern.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;As much as I love to travel, this was&nbsp;always intended to be temporary,&rdquo; Henrikson&nbsp;says.</p><p class="p2"><strong>Going the Distance</strong></p><p class="p1">Unlike Andreeff and Henrikson, many alumni&nbsp;wait and work for a few years before establishing&nbsp;their goals and making the move to a foreign&nbsp;country. Laura Ginsberg, who graduated&nbsp;from Northwestern with an education degree&nbsp;in 2004, decided three and a half years later&nbsp;that her plans were broader than teaching in&nbsp;the United States. She didn&rsquo;t just want to teach&nbsp;or continue doing educational consulting <span class="s1">&mdash;&nbsp;</span>she wanted to learn.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I had always wanted to learn to speak&nbsp;Spanish and get to know another culture on a&nbsp;deeper level than just a tourist,&rdquo; says Ginsberg,&nbsp;who travelled extensively while growing up&nbsp;and always dreamt of living abroad. &ldquo;At that&nbsp;point, everything was replaceable, and what&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t replaceable was the opportunity to&nbsp;move somewhere.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">In 2007, Ginsberg flew to Buenos Aires&nbsp;with a friend. She started to learn Spanish, and&nbsp;after a year when her friend left, she stayed.&nbsp;Ginsberg eventually applied for and landed a&nbsp;job at UVCMS, an e-learning company. She&nbsp;worked there for three years as a senior project&nbsp;manager before being hired at Loom, Inc. in&nbsp;April 2010 as the director of course development.&nbsp;Now 30, she says she has no regrets&nbsp;about her decision to pursue a nonconventional&nbsp;career path.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;In the States there&rsquo;s this feeling that there&rsquo;s&nbsp;a set way to do things and a set timing. I think&nbsp;it&rsquo;s perceived as avoidant rather than looking&nbsp;at all the growth that happens when you live&nbsp;somewhere else,&rdquo; Ginsberg says. &ldquo;I just felt like&nbsp;while I was inclined to follow that cultural or&nbsp;societal mentality, I also knew that I wanted to&nbsp;do something different.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">The transition has not been easy, however.&nbsp;Ginsberg says that Argentina is filled with &ldquo;nuances&rdquo;&nbsp;that she is unaccustomed to, and that&nbsp;she had to learn the language before she could&nbsp;start to understand the culture. There are also&nbsp;elements of &ldquo;professional culture&rdquo; that differ&nbsp;from her U.S. standards; she says that her co-workers express no guilt leaving their desks at&nbsp;5:59 p.m. when workdays end at 6, whereas in&nbsp;the U.S., employees may feel obligated to stay&nbsp;late or take work home with them. At the same&nbsp;time, her co-workers have become some of her&nbsp;closest friends, along with fellow expatriates.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;They have made me challenge my own&nbsp;thinking and my own habits and truths that I&nbsp;thought were universal,&rdquo; Ginsberg says.</p><p class="p1">Despite her established community, Ginsberg&nbsp;says she plans to move back to the U.S.&nbsp;one day to be closer to her family. But across&nbsp;the Atlantic, 2003 grad Charlotte Bonham-Carter has lived in London for seven years &mdash;&nbsp;long enough to consider the city her home.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be here forever,&rdquo; Bonham-Carter says. &ldquo;I married an English citizen, and&nbsp;we have a house and cats, so I&rsquo;d say my life is&nbsp;pretty settled here.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">For Bonham-Carter, the decision to move&nbsp;to England was spontaneous, and initially,&nbsp;not meant to be permanent. After graduating&nbsp;from Northwestern, she worked at a Chicago&nbsp;arts organization for a year and a half. But&nbsp;despite the fun she had in college and the year&nbsp;afterwards, she grew bored of always hanging&nbsp;out with the same people and going to the same&nbsp;bars. &ldquo;I just wanted to close that chapter in my&nbsp;life,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">Upon her acceptance to a master&rsquo;s curatorial&nbsp;program in San Francisco, she thought the&nbsp;next chapter had&nbsp;begun. But during&nbsp;a tour of the school,&nbsp;she learned that the&nbsp;program was actually&nbsp;modeled on one&nbsp;at the Royal College&nbsp;of Art in London.&nbsp;On a whim, she&nbsp;applied and got in.&nbsp;Two years later, she &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t feel like&rdquo; moving&nbsp;back home.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;When I moved over, I think I thought I&nbsp;was going to move back to Chicago after the&nbsp;two years, and I remember kind of thinking,&nbsp;should I just put my stuff in Chicago in storage&nbsp;for a couple years, because I&rsquo;ll be back?&rdquo;&nbsp;Bonham-Carter says. &ldquo;And then I maybe, deep&nbsp;down inside, knew that it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily&nbsp;going to happen.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">Even though London is the ideal location&nbsp;for aspiring curators, finding a permanent,&nbsp;paid position proved to be difficult, especially&nbsp;one in a museum as opposed to a commercial&nbsp;gallery. She signed a one-year contract at the&nbsp;Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, filling&nbsp;in for a woman on maternity leave. After that,&nbsp;she filled two more year-long maternity covers&nbsp;in London. The third time, the woman never&nbsp;returned, and Bonham-Carter took her place.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I think that it&rsquo;s good advice to go for those&nbsp;opportunities,&rdquo; Bonham-Carter says. &ldquo;You can&nbsp;get a better job than if you look for a permanent&nbsp;position from the start.&ldquo;</p><p class="p1">Bonham-Carter admits that she envisions&nbsp;herself moving back to the States for a year&nbsp;or two, just to &ldquo;touch base,&rdquo; and she says she&nbsp;realizes that not everyone will connect to a new&nbsp;city like she has. Her advice for those individuals&nbsp;is to go away anyway in order to gain new&nbsp;insights into life.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;Experience in a city like London, where&nbsp;there are so many opportunities, is likely to&nbsp;further your career wherever you end up,&rdquo;&nbsp;Bonham-Carter says.</p><p class="p2"><strong>Ready, Set, Goals</strong></p><p class="p1">Christina Siders, senior career counselor at&nbsp;University Career Services (UCS), says she&nbsp;sees several students each year who are interested&nbsp;in positions abroad. She works with both&nbsp;undergraduate and graduate students, helping&nbsp;them clarify their career goals.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I can probably count on one hand the&nbsp;number of students that have been opposed&nbsp;to the idea of working abroad,&rdquo; Siders says.&nbsp;She says she has noticed this willingness to&nbsp;explore new parts of the world in conjunction&nbsp;with an increase in students who already have&nbsp;international experience on their resumes from&nbsp;high school. From volunteer or religious trips&nbsp;to exchange programs, Siders says &ldquo;students&nbsp;come in with a higher level of comfort living in&nbsp;another place outside of their home country,&nbsp;and as a result, want to continue to expose&nbsp;themselves to new ideas and new cultures.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">Siders&rsquo; counseling is personalized, yet it&nbsp;involves some distinct steps, the first being a&nbsp;bit of a reality check for&nbsp;some.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I would say, first&nbsp;and foremost, the student&nbsp;needs to recognize&nbsp;that it&rsquo;s a time-intensive&nbsp;and sometimes more&nbsp;challenging search,&rdquo;&nbsp;Siders says. &ldquo;Then, I ask&nbsp;them what their goal is&nbsp;for the next few years. Maybe they just want to&nbsp;travel, but maybe not immerse themselves in a&nbsp;new country.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">Ginsberg also emphasized the importance&nbsp;of goal-setting prior to making any drastic&nbsp;decisions to move abroad.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;I think if you don&rsquo;t have a set purpose, you&nbsp;flounder,&rdquo; Ginsberg says. &ldquo;I always knew that&nbsp;at the end of the day my purpose here was to&nbsp;learn Spanish fluently and learn the Argentine&nbsp;culture. It was a personal rather than a professional&nbsp;objective.&rdquo;</p><p class="p1">Siders also encourages students who are serious&nbsp;about moving to a foreign country to join&nbsp;alumni networks, available to Northwestern&nbsp;graduates in cities all over the world. Bonham-&nbsp;Carter says she has become involved with and&nbsp;built relationships out of the groups in London.</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;You end up hanging out with these people&nbsp;even though you don&rsquo;t know them that well,&nbsp;because you&rsquo;re in the same city, and that&rsquo;s quite&nbsp;nice,&rdquo; Bonham-Carter says. &ldquo;Northwestern&nbsp;alumni are always around the world, so it&rsquo;s not&nbsp;like you&rsquo;re always going to be the only person&nbsp;who&rsquo;s in that city.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">However far away, maybe the unofficial&nbsp;maxim really is true:</p><p class="p1">&ldquo;You can leave Evanston, but Evanston&nbsp;never leaves you.&rdquo;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
