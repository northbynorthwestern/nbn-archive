Do you want to impress that guy by acting like you know what you&#8217;re talking about, or that girl by showing off your manly sports knowledge? Don&#8217;t worry, Northwestern, we&#8217;re here to help you out &#8212; just as the seasons are getting exciting.</p><p><strong>Soccer:</strong><br />
Two 45-minute halves<br />
11-on-11</p><p>The objective for a soccer team is to move the ball down the field by passing or dribbling and then shooting the ball into a goal that is eight feet tall by eight yards wide. Each team has one designated goalkeeper who (shockingly) guards his or her team’s goal from the opposing team&#8217;s shots. The goalkeeper is the only player on the field who can touch the ball with his or her hands, but can only do so in the marked penalty area.</p><p>Balls that go out of play along the sideline result in throw-ins for the team who did not last touch the ball before it went out-of-bounds. When a ball last touched by an attacking team leaves the field over the end line, the other team gets a goal kick. The ball is placed inside the area around the goal and a player, generally the goalkeeper, will kick the ball back into play. If the ball goes over the end line and was last touched by a defending team, the attacking team receives a corner kick. The ball is positioned within one-yard of the corner flag and a player will generally attempt to cross the ball to the center of the penalty area for a teammate to score.</p><p>If the score is tied at the completion of the second half, the teams play up to two 10-minute golden goal overtime periods. In those periods, if either side scores, that team instantly wins the game. If neither team scores in the two overtime periods, the game ends in a tie.</p><p>There are many different fouls in soccer that earn a free kick for the team of the fouled player. Offsides is called when a player on an attacking team positions him or herself behind all members of the defending team, excluding the goalkeeper, and the ball is kicked towards the player. However, when a player is on his or her side of the field, this rule does not apply.</p><p>Other common infractions include a handball, in which a player other than the goalkeeper &#8212; or the goalkeeper when outside of the penalty area &#8212; touches the ball with his or her hand or arm. Players also cannot push or in any other way use their hands to gain an advantage over another player. In slide tackling, in which a player slides with one foot extended in an attempt to knock the ball away from an opposing player, the slide tackle can legally make direct contact with the opposing player only if the slide tackler touches the ball first.</p><p><em>Why you should care:</em></p><p>The Northwestern men’s soccer team is one of the top programs in the country. Entering this week, the ‘Cats were ranked 17th in the nation, though that ranking will likely fall slightly after an overtime loss to Wisconsin. Still, men’s soccer is a chance to see Northwestern compete for a national title. Last year, Northwestern was ranked as high as second in the nation before falling in the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament.</p><p>Despite the U.S. traditionally branding soccer as boring or slow, few sports can rival the intensity and drama of a tied soccer game in the 90th minute, where one small mistake can make the difference between a win and a loss. Plus, with golden goal overtime, the game can end at any moment.</p><p>If the potential drama of soccer isn’t enough, a soccer game provides the rare opportunity to sing in public without people yelling at you. In fact, it’s encouraged! </p><p><strong>Volleyball:</strong><br />
Best of five sets<br />
6-on-6</p><p>In volleyball, teams play a series of games, known as sets, with the winning team winning three of the five sets. The first four games are played to 25 points, while the final game, if necessary, is played to 15 points.</p><p>There are several different ways to earn a point in volleyball. The most commonly known way is to have the ball land in the opponents’ side of the court. Another way to win a point is by making the other team hit the ball out. Each side has three hits on the ball to get it back over the net, but no player can touch the ball two consecutive times. If after three touches the ball has not gone back over the net, the opposing team earns a point.</p><p>Each point begins with a serve. The team that won the previous point serves the ball by hitting it overhand from behind the serving line at the back of the court. The serve must go over the net, but can make contact with the net, provided that it still reaches the other side of the net without a touch by a teammate.</p><p>In general, teams will use all three of their allowed hits in a pass, set, hit pattern. Defensively, the opposing team’s hitters will often jump into the air at the time of a hit, and attempt to block the ball immediately back over the net.</p><p>Several different infractions result in the forfeiture of a point in volleyball. If a player at anytime during the point touches the net, she has “netted” and the opposing team wins the point. A common penalty on setters is a “lift,” when a setter has made prolonged contact with the ball, and is therefore not hitting it, but carrying it.</p><p>With six players on each team on the court, players orient themselves with three in the front and three in the back. The two players on the outside in the front row are the outside hitters, while the front middle is the setter. Immediately behind the setter is a middle hitter, who despite playing in the back row, will often receive sets from the setter.</p><p>In addition to these specializations, teams have a libero, who is the defensive specialist on the team. The libero is generally one of the best passers on the team and excels at receiving serves or hits from the other team.</p><p>Volleyball operates on rally scoring, where either side can earn a point at anytime, regardless of who served the ball initially.</p><p><em>Why you should care:</em></p><p>You know the noise of a packed gym for a big basketball game? Actually, you go to Northwestern, so maybe not. But at some point in your life, you’ve probably to a basketball game that filled the arena with energy. That same energy and noise can occur at a volleyball game. For fans looking for another reason to make a lot of noise, if you get caught up in volleyball &#8212; and if you actually start to follow volleyball, you will get caught up in it &#8212; it can provide the same thrill and environment as basketball.</p><p>Additionally, with rally scoring, there’s never a dull moment in a volleyball match. At anytime, either team can score no matter who served, so both sides are always on the offensive. In a tight set, as both sides near 25 points, one solid defensive play to get a point and get the serve back can decide a game.</p><p>The Wildcats&#8217; women’s volleyball team is a young group right now that will only become stronger in the future. The ‘Cats currently have only two seniors, with a lot of talent in the junior and sophomore classes. Having already topped last year’s eight-win season with an 11-9 record currently, the women’s volleyball program has already begun a climb. Now is your chance to be one of the first on the bandwagon.</p><p><strong>Football:</strong><br />
Four 15-minute quarters<br />
11 players on both offense and defense</p><p>The objective of football is for the offense to move the ball towards the other teams end zone by means of handing the ball to a running back or having the quarterback throw the ball to a wide receiver. The offense has four downs to move the ball 10 yards or the other team gets the ball. On 4th down, teams will often punt the ball if they are on their side of the field or kick a field goal if they are close to the other teams end zone. </p><p>On a field goal attempt, the ball is snapped to a holder, who holds the ball with one end on the ground as the kicker attempts to kick the ball between the goal posts at the back of the end zone. Teams rarely attempt field goals longer than 50 yards because of the length, however the NCAA record for longest field goal made is an astonishing 67 yards. 6 points are awarded for a touchdown and 3 points for a field goal. After a touchdown, the offense gets the ball at the 2-yard line and can either kick an extra point, worth 1 point, or attempt a 2-point conversion. </p><p>A coin flip at the beginning of each game determines who receives the kick off at the beginning of each half. If the two teams are tied at the end of 60 minutes, the game goes to overtime. Each team gets one possession from the opponent’s 25-yard line in overtime. If still tied, the game goes into additional overtimes until a winner prevails. Traditionally, the away team wears white jerseys and the home team wears jerseys in their team colors.</p><p><em>Why you should care:</em></p><p>Last year, the Wildcats won nine games, which earned them a place in the Alamo Bowl against Missouri. If Northwestern wins six games, they are eligible for a bowl game so root on the Wildcats this season as they strive for another chance at a bowl victory.</p><p>Another reason? Excitement. One of the most exciting games in Northwestern history occurred in 2000 when Northwestern beat the University of Michigan 54-51 in a shootout at Ryan Field. The teams traded touchdowns throughout the game and with only 55 seconds left Michigan had the ball up 51-46. Only needing a first down to win the game, the Michigan running back fumbled the ball and Northwestern scored the go-ahead touchdown to take to take the lead 52-51. The Wildcats then converted the 2-point conversion to go up 54-51 and they beat the 12th ranked Wolverines.</p><p><strong>Field Hockey:</strong></p><p>2 35-minute halves<br />
11 attackers and defenders</p><p>Field Hockey is played on a field 100 yards long and the goal is for the attacking team to move the ball by the use of a stick, which is curved at the bottom.</p><p>Players may only touch the ball with the stick and can either dribble it, push it forward or pass it to a teammate. A goal is scored when the ball goes into the goal and is either shot by an attacker standing inside the shooting circle or is deflected off a defender’s stick inside the circle.</p><p>Unlike in ice hockey, field hockey players cannot use both sides of the stick, and have to twist their sticks to change the direction of the ball or to make a move.</p><p>Common fouls include obstruction, when a defender intentionally blocks the attacker from reaching the ball, and dangerous play. Fouls can result in free hits, penalty corners or penalty strokes. On a penalty stroke, an offensive player stands seven yards from the goaltender and shoots the ball.</p><p>Field Hockey has been an Olympic sport for over one hundred years. The Netherlands won the 2008 gold medal defeating the host country China 2-0.  </p><p><em>Why you should care:</em></p><p>The Northwestern women’s field hockey team is having a great season and they hope to win the Big Ten tournament beginning on November 5. Their season is winding down, but they have a shot at being one of the best teams in Northwestern history.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
