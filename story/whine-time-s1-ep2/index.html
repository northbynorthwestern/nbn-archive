And we&rsquo;re reclaiming the word jappy.</p><p>Carrie: And this is Whine Time. So&hellip;</p><p>Dani: Welcome back! We kind of blew up. We&rsquo;re campus celebrities, guys. What the fuck?</p><p>Carrie: OK, so the word of the week is &ldquo;insane.&rdquo; My mom says that I&rsquo;ve been using it too much and that I&rsquo;m a smart girl who should be able to think of other words to say when I&rsquo;m flabbergasted by something, but I just always say insane.</p><p>Dani: That&rsquo;s insane.</p><p>Carrie: It is! So if you hear us say it, everyone please take a drink.</p><p>Dani: This week&rsquo;s show is brought to you by wine juice boxes!</p><p>First up, whine about it, where we complain about shit. And you can complain about shit! Send us an email: <a href="mailto:whinetimenbn@gmail.com" target="_blank">whinetimenbn@gmail.com</a>.</p><p>Carrie: If you have anything that you&rsquo;re really pissed about and you want to hear us be pissed about too, just send an email about it and we will talk about it.</p><p>Dani: I honestly think this week&rsquo;s might be a little bit heated, but this is the Cupitol pronunciation.</p><p>Carrie: Oh my god, so real. I&rsquo;ve honestly had physical fights with my friends about this.</p><p>Dani: Same! OK, I believe it&rsquo;s Coop-ee-tall because I like to believe things are classy and I believe it&rsquo;s a beautiful European thing.</p><p>Carrie: No, I love it.</p><p>Dani: But then Carrie and I were kind of breaking it down because they do call it Cupital there. And Carrie was like&hellip;</p><p>Carrie: You walk in and they say, &ldquo;Welcome to Cupital.&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: And Carrie said that&rsquo;s probably like capital, but with a U, but what if it is, cup-it-all. Like put it all in a cup.</p><p>Carrie: And it makes sense because everything in there is served in a cup. Right?</p><p>Dani: I mean, not everything. Well, actually, now that I&rsquo;m thinking about it. Even the plates, if you think about it, they&rsquo;re all rounded up slightly.</p><p>Carrie: Like a bowl?</p><p>Dani: Like a bowl. Like a cup. Like cupping it all.</p><p>Carrie: See how we got there? It&rsquo;s definitely Cupital. I will always call it Coop-ee-tall.</p><p>Dani: Are we being unnecessarily bougie?</p><p>Carrie: Always.</p><p>Dani: Ok, that&rsquo;s fair.</p><p>Carrie: But like, it&rsquo;s fine.</p><p>Dani: They recognize my big like they know her order.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah because I&rsquo;m always there with her. And when I&rsquo;m not they go, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your friend?&rdquo;</p><p>Dani: Next up, I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else saw this. Bella Thorne snapchatted her entire first bikini-wax ever.</p><p>Carrie: The whole thing, like it&rsquo;s all up there and honestly, Bella Thorne is my idol because like&hellip;</p><p>Dani: Really? Ugh.</p><p>Carrie: She just does like whatever the fuck she wants.</p><p>Dani: OK, I appreciate that. That&rsquo;s like good for you. My mom actually texted me about her last week. She just looks really uh a lot now.</p><p>Carrie: Oh, she looks disgusting.</p><p>Dani: And I totally respect like do your thing. Honestly, if anything, I won&rsquo;t lie. Her snapchatting this made me like her more.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah, no, it&rsquo;s really brave of her, and honestly we should all be snapchatting out bikini waxes. Would you ever snapchat your bikini wax?</p><p>Dani: I think I would. Honestly.</p><p>Carrie: I think you would too. I would not, but I feel like you definitely would.</p><p>Dani: I think I would.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, so we have Neha and Rose here. The new president and vice president of ASG. Congratulations.</p><p>Dani: Just a couple of campus celebrities hanging out. Casual.</p><p>Carrie: Yeah. It&rsquo;s just four campus celebrities hanging out. OK, so can you guys just introduce yourselves? Tell us briefly about yourselves.</p><p>Nehaarika (Neha) Mulukutla: I&rsquo;m Nehaarika. I&rsquo;m from Dallas, Texas. I&rsquo;m an avid Cowboys fan. I&rsquo;m a third year student here studying Economics, Legal Studies, minors in Entrepreneurship and Computer Science.</p><p>Carrie: So, you have a lot of free time.</p><p>Neha: Um, yeah.</p><p>Rosalie (Rose) Gambrah: I&rsquo;m Rose. I&rsquo;m also from Texas. I&rsquo;m a third year studying Poli Sci &ndash;I almost said Econ&ndash; Poli Sci and Legal Studies and I&rsquo;m a minor in Classics.</p><p>Carrie: So, we gave Neha and Rose some of our classic wine boxes.</p><p>Dani: But with their faces on it.</p><p>Carrie: Check out our Twitter.</p><p>Dani: Basically, if you want to come on this show we will provide you with free alcohol.</p><p>Carrie: So, can you guys just like go over what exactly you do in simplest terms? I&rsquo;m a junior and I still have no clue.</p><p>Dani: Are you my president?</p><p>Neha: Our constituency is everybody on this campus. I&rsquo;m your president, bow to me bitch.</p><p>Rose: ASG is the Associated Student Government. It controls all funding for student groups. So, like the student activities fee that everyone pays with tuition goes to ASG, and that&rsquo;s how you have events like Dillo, A&amp;O Blowout, because ASG funds&hellip;</p><p>Carrie: I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p><p>Rose: Yeah, ASG funds all ASG-recognized student groups on campus.</p><p>Neha: I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;re not really a government as much as we are a union. That&rsquo;s kind of how I feel like we should be thought of is like we are the student union. We advocate on behalf of students to the administration what students actually want to do. Because a lot of times I think the administrators are all like 900-year-old people who like don&rsquo;t understand what exactly student life here means and it&rsquo;s not their fault, but it&rsquo;s just like it&rsquo;s our job and responsibility to tell them like this is what and average day to day student at Northwestern experiences and this is how you need to mitigate these issues.</p><p>Carrie: Why did no one run against you guys?</p><p>Rose: We are that intimidating.</p><p>Dani: Is that rude of us to ask?</p><p>Rose: No!</p><p>Dani: We weren&rsquo;t sure.</p><p>Rose: They knew they would lose.</p><p>Neha: Oh shit! Rose getting real. No I mean we subsumed our competition. We ate them for lunch. That&rsquo;s what happened.</p><p>Carrie: That&rsquo;s good. I like that. Strong women. Bitch is the new black. I love it.</p><p>Rose: There was some drama.</p><p>Neha: There was a lot of drama.</p><p>Carrie: Ooh I love drama.</p><p>Rose: There was some drama should we get into the drama?</p><p>Dani: Yes! We love drama.</p><p>Neha: But the thing is there were other people considering running, but it wasn&rsquo;t like they saw us running and they were too scared to run. It was more like some of them just I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Carrie: Chickened out?</p><p>Neha: Couldn&rsquo;t get their shit together.</p><p>Carrie: Couldn&rsquo;t handle the heat.</p><p>Neha: Yeah.</p><p>Carrie: OK, let&rsquo;s move on to some more fun questions. Dani, want to go?</p><p>Dani: So, we heard you guys are trying to make NU a wet campus. A, is that the right word like it sounds dirty.</p><p>Carrie: That sounds really dirty.</p><p>Dani: But B, is that true</p><p>Neha: Well, OK I think there&rsquo;s a lot of contention. Not contention, but like there&rsquo;s a lot of misunderstanding around what the term dry campus and wet campus means so I think we&rsquo;re going to start straying away from that and just saying like we want to do alcohol policy reform, and what that means is we want to be able &mdash; I think some of the big things that we want to push for is like open door policy, like the way that Wash U has and so Wash U, basically their alcohol policy is if you live in a dorm and you&rsquo;re under 21 you can drink just as long as your door is open and you&rsquo;re within visibility of your RA.</p><p>Carrie: Oh, wow.</p><p>Neha: Right. So it&rsquo;s just like from a logistical perspective, that may be&ndash;like that puts a lot of liability&hellip;</p><p>Dani: That&rsquo;s very smart.</p><p>Neha: But yeah.</p><p>Rose: It puts a lot of liability on the school, but&hellip;</p><p>Dani: But it also stops people from like binging.</p><p>Rose: And like going&hellip;</p><p>Carrie: And like if someone&rsquo;s in trouble, it&rsquo;s seen.</p><p>Neha: Yeah, like I remember there was this time I took like 15 minutes to get home when I was like right next to the sorority quad and I lived in Willard.</p><p>Dani: OK, I was literally on Sheridan like walking home one day like really really late at night with someone like going home to Bobb and I don&rsquo;t know how, but we were like jumping over buildings, going through fences. I swear to God.</p><p>Carrie: Dani you&rsquo;re like three feet tall, you can&rsquo;t jump over buildings.</p><p>Dani: No I fell off a building, and I broke my ankle.</p><p>Carrie: Sad turn. Sad turn.</p><p>Neha: Reform the alcohol policy @PTI!</p><p>Dani: What is your least favorite building on campus?</p><p>Neha: Oh god. There&rsquo;s so many of them.</p><p>Dani: I know.</p><p>Rose: There are so many.</p><p>Dani: You can do like a top five.</p><p>Neha: God there&rsquo;s so many buildings that are disgusting about this campus. Ok right now. This is just like a side note. Right now, I just really hate that weird steam piping area that they&rsquo;re constructing in front on University. Every time you walk there and there&rsquo;s wind it smells like piss.</p><p>Carrie: It&rsquo;s so awful. It&rsquo;s so awful.</p><p>Dani: Who&rsquo;s your campus crush?</p><p>Carrie: They will hear this.</p><p>Dani: Yeah. We&rsquo;re pretty much famous at this point.</p><p>Neha: What if they like put this on the internet and then he like asks me out? That needs to be the ROI that I set.</p><p>Carrie: And then we will perform at your wedding.</p><p>Dani: We will perform a podcast.</p><p>Neha: Promise that this is the ROI that I get.</p><p>Rose: Who is my campus crush?</p><p>Neha: Yeah, who is my campus crush?</p><p>Rose: I&rsquo;m thinking.</p><p>Carrie: Take a second.</p><p>Neha: I have one.</p><p>Carrie: OK. Go.</p><p>Neha: Oh my god. No so we interviewed him for our ASG exec board, and like, this is the first time I ever met him and I was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with you. Like why are you so awesome?&rdquo; He did like sexual violence refugee work in Serbia. Right? Like so cool. And he&rsquo;s just like so aware of everything and just like so I don&rsquo;t know so&hellip;.</p><p>Carrie: So what&rsquo;s his name?</p><p>Dani: I feel like he knows now. He knows.</p><p>Neha: Yeah like how many people do Serbian refugee work?</p><p>Carrie: Yeah that&rsquo;s so real so real. All these guys start texting us like, &ldquo;Can you get us in touch with Neha? I did Serbian refugee work.&rdquo;</p><p>OK, so we&rsquo;ll let you guys go, we just have one final question.</p><p>Neha: Oh shit.</p><p>Carrie: Who&rsquo;s prettier? Me or Dani?</p><p>Dani: Be honest. We need brutal honesty.</p><p>Rose: What?</p><p>Carrie: We&rsquo;re keeping a tally for every guest we have.</p><p>Neha: What if I said I didn&rsquo;t actually catch your names when walking in, so like I don&rsquo;t know who you are. Like I do know who you are.</p><p>Dani: Point and then they don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Neha: Oh yeah.</p><p>Carrie: Oh my god!</p><p>Dani: It was me.</p><p>Carrie: No it wasn&rsquo;t. It was our phallic microphone.</p><p>Neha: No it is! It&rsquo;s so phallic! That&rsquo;s the first thing I thought about.</p><p>Carrie: And also you&rsquo;re like getting up close to it.</p><p>Dani: The first time it was the two of us and we were like this is kind of hot.</p><p>Neha: It&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s like a lot.</p><p>Carrie: Ok, fair. Don&rsquo;t want to make any enemies.</p><p>Neha: But I do know you&rsquo;re Dani, and you&rsquo;re Carrie. I got it.</p><p>Carrie: OK, thank you guys so much for listening yet again. Everyone, if you have any questions, if you need advice...</p><p>Dani: We&rsquo;re great at advice.</p><p>Carrie: We&rsquo;re great at advice.</p><p>Dani: We&rsquo;re super stable!</p><p>Carrie: We have our lives together and we want to help you now. And if you have anything that you just want to whine about, email us at <a href="mailto:whinetimenbn@gmail.com" target="_blank">whinetimenbn@gmail.com</a>. That&rsquo;s whine with an h so w-h-i-n-e-t-i-m-e-n-b-n@gmail.com.</p><p>Dani: I thought you were going to fuck up.</p><p>Carrie: Hell yes. So did I. And then also follow us on Twitter.</p><p>Dani: Same thing.</p><p>Carrie: Also whinetimenbn.</p><p>Dani: And subscribe on iTunes! We&rsquo;re on iTunes bitches!</p><p>Carrie: Nobody knows how it happened, but it happened, so subscribe, rate us, give us five stars.</p><p>Dani: Say you love us, we changed your life. We&rsquo;re trying to get into the top ten, baby.</p><p>Carrie: Honestly, like we&rsquo;re trying to get famous, so help us out.</p><p>Dani: And now, for this week&rsquo;s advice, coming straight from my mother. She said, &ldquo;no one will buy the cow if you give them the milk for free. And no one wants a used cow. These are metaphors. I hope your audience gets that.&rdquo;</p><p>Carrie: I think it&rsquo;s for sex.</p><p>Dani: I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s what she said every time she drove me to my boyfriend in high school&rsquo;s house.</p><p>Carrie: And did you listen to that advice?</p><p>Dani: Of course.</p><p>Carrie: Absolutely not.</p><p>Dani: Waiting for marriage.</p><p>Carrie: OK. I&rsquo;m Carrie Twersky.</p><p>Dani: I&rsquo;m Dani Cohen.</p><p>Carrie and Dani: And this is NBN Audio.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
