The movies that leave us cringing and wondering “why?” but ones that we’re ultimately going to see anyway. <em>She’s Out Of My League</em> tells the story of an average Joe who meets his perfect woman. The movie opens March 12. </p><p>North by Northwestern participated in a conference call with Jay Baruchel (<em>Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist</em>) and Nate Torrence (<em>Get Smart</em>). The stars talked about April Fools&#8217; Day, whether Elisha Cuthbert really is out of Baruchel’s league and their upcoming film. </p><div style="width: 250px; float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 15px;"><img src="../../media/uploads/2010/03/shes_out_of_my_league.jpeg"><div class="caption">Image courtesy of IMDB.</div></div><p><strong>Do you think that this film has the potential to be a classic of this generation? </strong></p><p>Jay: Oh my gosh. Well if it isn’t, we’ll eat these words.  I think that [the movie] could hit a nerve. I’ll just be psyched if kids dig it at all.  </p><p>Nate: But I definitely think there is potential… it’s the kind of movie that people will tell their friends to watch.  And I think it might be the DVD kind of thing that gets passed around a lot.  So, maybe a cult classic?<br /><strong><br />
Director Jim Field Smith has a background in sketch comedy and this was his first big feature film. How does that sort of directing experience stretch over to working on this movie? </strong></p><p>Nate: Well, he was also a sketch performer in his own right, so his mind is just wired comedically and so he always knew what was funny… I think he had pretty good instincts.  What about you? </p><p>Jay: Totally.  I think he did a great job as far as not only letting us play, but also being able to control the tone of it all.  And yes, I think he did an amazing job for a first timer. I was never worried. He’s a funny guy. </p><p><strong>What personal touches have you added to your characters to make them seem more &#8212; not just a caricature &#8212; but more of a guy people can relate to? </strong></p><p>Nate: I think all of us really tried as hard as we [could], not just with characters, but with the whole movie. We wanted to make it reality… and he let us play [the part] all the way…. Even with our lunch scene we all got to choose what we thought our character would eat. </p><p>Jay: And I was the smart one. I chose to eat nothing because I know how gross it is to eat on camera.  But you’ve got to make [the characters] sympathetic and accessible…. So it’s a question of just inserting yourself a bit more into it at certain points.   </p><p><strong>I know you both have a background in comedy acting, and with April Fool&#8217;s Day coming up, what’s the best April Fool&#8217;s Day joke you’ve played or that has been played on you? </strong></p><p>Jay: Wow. </p><p>Nate: You know, I guess it’s not even about the joke as much as it was about the time in my life.  I was in fourth grade. I Saran-wrapped my dad’s toilet and put baby powder on all the fans in our house. I thought I was brilliant. It may not be the greatest joke as an adult, but man to a fourth grader, I seriously was like the MacGyver of April Fools’.  I was amazing.   </p><p>Jay: I covered a phone receiver in hand lotion and then called said phone.   </p><p>Nate: Well done, well played, check and mate. </p><p>Jay: Check and mate. </p><p><strong>I was wondering what it was like working with Jim Field Smith, compared to Judd Apatow or Ben Stiller? </strong></p><p>Jay: I mean each thing is its own… It’s a different beast. Jim was a sketch comedy actor and a director over in England, so his mind is wired a certain way and he has his own sensibility. I guess the connection between the three of them would be that they all allowed me to ad lib.  Mind you, I don’t really give anyone much choice.  I will ad-lib no matter what.  Whether or not they use it is a whole different story.  I think the main difference would be [Jim Field Smith’s] quintessential dry, English humor. </p><p><strong>This question’s more for Jay.  When you co-hosted Canadian TV show, “Popular Mechanics for Kids,” with Elisha Cuthbert… </strong></p><p>Jay: Yes. </p><p><strong>… Even then was she out of your league? </strong></p><p>Jay: What makes you think she was ever out of my league? </p><p><strong>Elisha Cuthbert. </strong></p><p>Jay: Let me make sure you heard the name right.  Listen, I know it’s slim pickings in Alberta sometimes but no… you’re killing me here… I think I’m going to have to go with no comment, my friend. </p><p><strong>Jay, you’ve found in a niche for yourself &#8212; and I mean this in the nicest possible sense &#8211;</strong></p><p>Jay: Oh God, here it is. </p><p><strong>As the nice dweeby guy.  How similar would you say you are to this character type? </strong></p><p>Jay: Oh gosh… I’d like to think I’m nice. I’ve spent a lot of time by myself, so in those respects, I’m similar. I think I’m a lot crazier than people know &#8212; I also grew up in one of the worst neighborhoods in Montreal so I guess that lends something to it. I think close enough, but that’s definitely not me 100 percent. </p><p><strong>Why do you think this movie will appeal to college students and what makes it different from other romantic comedies? </strong></p><p>Nate: That&#8217;s a good question. What makes it different is that the heart of the movie has a chutzpah to it, [which] kind of elevates it. I really think that we have four sympathetic characters and there&#8217;s not a there&#8217;s not a douche bag among us. Not to say other movies do, but I think that this time, it&#8217;s four nice guys.  And what college students will like about it &#8212; it&#8217;s a hell of a fun way to spend two hours. </p><p><strong>Could you describe a little bit what the dynamics were like on set, and are there any interesting stories that you&#8217;d be able to share from filming? </strong></p><p>Jay: Some of them. Nate got me an awesome birthday present. </p><p>Nate: That&#8217;s a nice one. </p><p>Jay: The dynamic on the set was much the dynamic of this phone conversation.  It was… a lot of laughter and wasted time permeated by moments of productivity.  I &#8216;d say we all just kind of found each other real funny. Poor Jim was basically the camp counselor trying to herd us and keep us in line right. </p><p>Nate: I think it was exactly like going to camp.  It was Poison Ivy.  </p><p>Jay: Poison Ivy is an erotic thriller.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
