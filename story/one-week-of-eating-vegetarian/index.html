After years of putting it off, I finally decided to go vegetarian for a week. I never particularly liked meat, and usually chose tofu as my protein when given the choice. One of my friends had gone vegan for a year and told me I should try it, too. Going vegan seemed like too much of a jump, so I decided to make vegetarianism a stepping stone.&nbsp;</p><h3>Monday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/monday_dinner.jpg" width="660" height="495" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>On Monday, a friend suggested we get Indian for dinner, and after looking up the menu for Mumbai Indian Grill, I agreed. I ordered the Aloo Chana, a curry made of chickpeas and potatoes. Between the blueberry bagel from Einstein&rsquo;s I had for lunch and the curry, I was definitely consuming a lot of carbs. The menu at Mumbai had a separate vegetarian entree section, which made it easier for me, as I didn&rsquo;t have to be tempted by non-vegetarian options. My friend ordered an eggplant curry, so that I could try that as well. My other friend, however, decided he would order my favorite curry, the Chicken Tikka Masala. Thanks a lot. The two vegetarian curries were delicious, as were the rice and naan.</p><h3>Tuesday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/tuesday_lunch.jpg" width="660" height="880" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>For Tuesday lunch, I decided to head to my number one on-campus dining spot: International Dish. Because I often get tofu as my protein, I thought ordering tofu would be an easy way to have a filling lunch while not breaking my vegetarian diet. But as I looked up at the TV screen listing the choices of sauces, I realized that the sauces I usually ate were all non-vegetarian. During my vegetarian week, I had four different sauce and carb combinations, all with tofu. Out of the four, only one was a success. Tuesday&rsquo;s lunch of Indian curry and white rice was not.&nbsp;</p><h3>Wednesday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/wednesday_breakfast.jpg" width="660" height="880" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>I grabbed an egg sandwich with spinach, mushroom and swiss and an orange juice from Einstein&rsquo;s while waiting for my next class to start on Wednesday morning. Although I missed the savory crunch of bacon in my sandwich, it was still pretty great. At the very least, the sandwich kept me full until lunch, which consisted of a rather disappointing salad from Frontera.</p><h3>Thursday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/thursday_late_night.jpg" width="660" height="880" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>My first meal on Thursday consisted of another less-than-stellar creation at International Dish. The only vegetarian protein option seemed to be jackfruit, and I could get it in a torta, taco or burrito. Because I was craving carbs, I went for the burrito. I usually love eating fruit with other food (I&rsquo;m a fan of pineapple pizza), but jackfruit in a burrito wasn&rsquo;t a good combination. I ended up picking out whatever lumps of jackfruit I could, and eating the remaining mix of tortilla, rice, onions and tomatoes.</p><h3>Friday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/friday_dinner2.jpg" width="660" height="880" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>I went grocery shopping at Whole Foods with two friends, who were making salmon with cream sauce for Friday&rsquo;s dinner. I tagged along and picked out a plant-based burger patty. Just in case it didn&rsquo;t turn out well, I also bought a box of mac n&rsquo; cheese from their hot food bar. The patties were actually smoky (although that might have been because I burned them a bit), and if they had been in an actual burger, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell they weren&rsquo;t meat. But my friends&rsquo; cream sauce and sauteed onion covered salmon looked amazing, and I couldn&rsquo;t tear my eyes off of it. Maybe I should have tried going pescatarian, instead?</p><h3>Saturday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/saturday_lunch.jpg" width="660" height="880" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>I had a scare Saturday afternoon; while I was eating a bowl of Cocoa Puffs, my suite-mate suddenly asked me if it was vegetarian! For a second, I was terrified that I had broken my vegetarian diet, until I realized I was eating something very far from meat and he had made a mistake. My biggest challenge of the week was Saturday dinner, when my friends and I had a barbecue. For some reason, I ended up in charge of cooking the meats, which meant I had to cook pork belly, steak strips, chicken breasts and Italian sausages. After throwing onions, asparagus and pineapple on the heat, I fried up the vegetarian sausages and patties I bought. They didn&rsquo;t taste bad, but still paled in comparison to the meats that were heaped on the table. I ended up sitting on the couch and eating a pint of ice cream to console myself. Hosting a barbecue as a vegetarian was clearly a bad decision.</p><h3>Sunday</h3><div><img src="http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/10/19/sunday_lunch.jpg" width="660" height="880" /><div class="caption">Photo by Yoonjie Park / North by Northwestern</div></div><p>I had meeting after meeting on Sunday, and it wasn&rsquo;t until mid-afternoon that I was able to make my way to Norris to grab a late lunch. Subway was one of the few options that was open, and after discovering the existence of a veggie patty, I was sold. Thanks to the sweet onion sauce and guacamole, the sandwich was quite good, and I could actually taste the slices of carrots and red peppers in my veggie patty. Despite my friend enjoying his sandwich with bacon across me, I was content with my own. I finished my meal with one of my favorite items from the C-store, a Peaches &amp; Cream Yogurt Parfait, looking forward to meaty Monday.</p><p>Although I am not a meat-lover, having to consciously avoid meat when making meal choices made me painfully aware of what I was missing. By Thursday, there was nothing more I wanted than a good cheeseburger. My favorite meal definitely was the falafel and hummus bowl from Naf Naf Grill, which I would get again even if I were allowed to eat meat.</p><p>I was surprised to find out that there was actually a large variety of things I could eat as a vegetarian, regardless of whether I ate on campus or not. I previously thought I would end up eating a salad for every meal, but instead I was able to tag along whenever my friends decided to eat downtown. The one difference I really noticed was how I would get hungry sooner, mainly because a large portion of my meals consisted of carbs. I originally thought I might lose a few pounds, which was not the case.</p><p>I also learned that my friends could definitely be split into two groups: those who supported and ate vegetarian meals with me, and those who questioned what I was doing and laughed at my veggie patties.</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
