It can be intimidating to start running if you’ve never placed yourself into that mindset before, but it’s not impossible.</p><p>Whether you’re an ex-cross-country star looking to regain your stride or a self-proclaimed bum who has never run in your life (except to lunch and to catch the bus), there’s still time to table your excuses and revive yourself from the winter slump you’ve been lulled into for the past five months. With a campus like this and a town like Evanston, there really is a run for everyone.</p><h2>Why run?</h2><p>Besides being a great cardiovascular workout, running can be its own form of therapy. It won’t take long for you to discover or rediscover the joys of the mythical “runner’s high.” A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296435?ordinalpos=6&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">recent scientific study</a> done in Germany corroborated this often-cited, rarely supported claim: It showed evidence of the “opioid theory,” which creates a feeling of euphoria after running. Running is like a legal drug &#8212; with health benefits.</p><p>Additionally, there have been numerous studies <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-spark17mar17,1,158821.story">that show physical fitness is correlated to mental fitness</a>. Getting in shape might counteract all of that heavy drinking that purportedly <a href="http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa63/aa63.htm">kills your brain cells</a>.</p><p>For most people who run, however, the benefits far exceed these quantifiable ones. Something about getting <em>out </em> and getting into the rhythm makes running something certain people can&#8217;t imagine living without &#8212; a way to clear your mind, center yourself and see the world in a different light.</p><p>&#8220;The simplicity of running is refreshing,&#8221; McCormick Junior Kyle Holmberg said. &#8220;You just put your shoes on and go. It’s an escape. Just you, your mind and the world around you &#8212; for 30 minutes, an hour.&#8221;</p><p>Holmberg, co-president of the <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/runners/welcome.html">Northwestern Running Club</a>, started running in eighth grade. &#8220;Running is a good way to set goals and work towards accomplishments,&#8221; he added. Holmberg has certainly put this philosophy into practice: He is a veteran of two Chicago Marathons and is training for the one coming up this October. </p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely a stress reliever,&#8221; he said.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p><a href="http://www.fitrec.northwestern.edu/classes/personal/bios.html#krochmal">Carol Krochmal</a>, a master personal trainer at SPAC, has run more than 48 marathons since she took up running at age 17. So, I ask her, what&#8217;s the first thing to think about when you&#8217;re starting from scratch? Well, your feet.</p><p>&#8220;One of the most important things is to have decent shoes,&#8221; Krochmal said. She attributed the aches and pains that sometimes plague and discourage new runners to bad running shoes. If you don&#8217;t already own a pair of shoes designed for running, “go to a good running store and have them evaluate what kind of shoe is best for you.” </p><p>The closest running specialty store to campus is <a href="http://evanstonillinois.net/murphysfit.html">Murphy&#8217;s Fit</a>, located on Dempster St. and Hinman Ave. You can also purchase running shoes at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/williams-shoes-the-walking-spirit-evanston">Williams Shoes</a>, at 710 Church St., and <a href="http://www.famousfootwear.com/">Famous Footwear</a>, at 817 Church St.</p><p>Once your feet are fitted up, don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_1/126.shtml">stretch</a>! Do it after you warm up for a couple of blocks and when you finish your run. The extra couple of minutes you spend doing this will pay off, so don&#8217;t skip it. Make sure to focus on your calves and hamstrings, the first places you&#8217;ll get sore when you are starting up.</p><p>When you&#8217;re first starting out, “run at a comfortable pace &#8212; don&#8217;t try to run full-out. When you get tired, walk a block and run again,” Krochmal advised. This way, you won’t tire yourself out before you complete a decent distance, and will be able to run for longer. </p><p>&#8220;Increase your distance by 10 to 20 percent per week,&#8221; Krochmal recommended. If you are starting out with one mile, don&#8217;t just jump to two miles the next day. Along with good shoes, this will prevent injuries like shin splints and blisters.</p><p>&#8220;If you need to and walk for part of it, or take a day off, you have to listen to your body and do that,&#8221; advised Holmberg for first time runners. &#8220;It&#8217;s important not to push yourself <em>too</em> hard when you&#8217;re first starting,&#8221; he said. Doing so will just cause you to get discouraged and give up before you can appreciate all the benefits of being a runner.</p><h2>Where to go</h2><p>One of the greatest joys of running is discovering your own favorite route, a secret path or hidden beach. Sometimes it&#8217;s great to just explore, running wherever your legs take you and stopping to rest and appreciate the beauty from the top of a lifeguard tower or beneath an ancient tree. The best routes are ones that you want to go on again and again. Here are four favorites:</p><p><center><img src= "../../media/uploads/2008/04/picture-3.png"></center></p><p><strong>For the novice:</strong> Ideal for beginners who want a shorter, familiar run, or for the expert who just can&#8217;t get enough of the Northwestern campus. Start at The Arch going southeast on Sheridan toward South Beach, and cut across to the path that runs along the beach, past the sailboats and left along the lake. Circle the Lakefill, stopping if you&#8217;re tired to revel in the beauty of the Chicago skyline, or for a quick pick-me-up at Willie&#8217;s Food Court. Just stay away from the chili dogs… at least until you&#8217;re out of your sneakers. It&#8217;s 1.84 miles; add 1.54 miles if starting from Patten. <em>(Contributed by Kelsi Lindus)</em></p><p><center><img src= "../../media/uploads/2008/04/picture-2.png"></center></p><p><strong>For the child at heart:</strong> Start at the Arch and run toward the lake until you hit the paved path following the shore. Run south, following the path, past tennis courts and a playground. Turn around when the road you’re running around dead ends at the end of the second beach. Make sure to stop by the playground (marked in red) on the way back to play on the swings and slides. It&#8217;s 2.5 miles round trip; add 1.54 miles if starting from Patten.</p><p><center><img src= "../../media/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.png"></center></p><p><strong>For the spiritualist: </strong>Start at Patten Gymnasium and follow Sheridan Rd. north for a simple run that will take you past the lighthouse just north of campus, through the beautiful neighborhoods along the lake and, finally, to the breathtaking destination: the <a href="http://www.bahai.us/bahai-temple">Bahai Temple</a>. If you&#8217;re quiet and there&#8217;s no service in session, check out the amazing interior of this structure; it&#8217;s one of only seven of its kind in the entire world. It&#8217;s 2.41 miles round trip; add 1.54 miles if starting from the Arch.</p><p><center><img src= "../../media/uploads/2008/04/picture-22.png"></center></p><p><strong>For the ex-cross-country legend: </strong>Start at the Arch and run north on Sheridan Rd., turning left down Central Street (a block past the big field by Elder). Central Street is home to Ryan Field as well as numerous shops and bakeries, and running along the sidewalk can serve as a refreshing reminder of life outside the Northwestern bubble and its tidy 18 to 22 age range. Resist the urge to stop by every bakery you see, and keep running until you hit <a href="http://www.greatharvest.com/">Great Harvest Bread Company</a> on the corner of Central and Hartrey Ave. Slip into this friendly bakery for some free samples and a cool drink before embarking on your journey back to campus. It&#8217;s 4.44 miles round trip; subtract 1.54 miles if starting from Patten. <em>(Contributed by Kelsi Lindus)</em></p><h2>Staying strong</h2><p>Sticking to a new exercise regime can be tough, especially when you&#8217;re not so in shape. But with the right tools, virtually anyone can work past the &#8220;pant gasp I give up&#8221; stage of running.</p><p><a href="http://www.fitrec.northwestern.edu/classes/personal/bios.html#sarrafi">Khashayar Sarrafi</a>, a master personal trainer at SPAC, recommends investing in a log book. &#8220;When you decide to get involved, log all your training from day one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you go back and look at it, you can see all you&#8217;ve done and how far you&#8217;ve come. It&#8217;s a really good tool to motivate you.&#8221;</p><p>Many free online tools can facilitate your progress. <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/create">MapMyRun.com</a> is a comprehensive online community for runners that abounds with useful tools, such as those that calculate the distance when you trace your path on a satellite map. Monitoring your progress can give you a greater feeling of accomplishment and a stronger commitment to keep at it.</p><p>Perhaps the best way to motivate yourself, as suggested by Sarrafi, is by signing up for a race, whether it&#8217;s a 5K fundraiser or, if you&#8217;re feeling ambitious, the <a href="http://www.chicagomarathon.com/cms400min/chicago_marathon/">Chicago Marathon</a>. There is always something coming up; look for signs in Norris or in Evanston, or check the Northwestern Running Club&#8217;s <a href="http://groups.northwestern.edu/runners/racing.html">Web site</a>.</p><p>Most 5Ks are fundraisers for charitable causes too, which is another reason to keep on running. &#8220;When you&#8217;re involved in a race, there is something to motivate you,&#8221; Sarrafi said. &#8220;And when you finish your first 5K, you&#8217;ll feel great.&#8221; </p><h2>Don&#8217;t get in a rut</h2><p>Even veteran runners sometimes get stuck in a mundane, repetitious cycle, running the same two miles, at the same pace, on the same route, day after day. “Garbage miles — that’s what marathon runners refer to those as,” Krochmal said. So how do you break the routine and start actually getting something out of your workout? Speed intervals, tempo runs and hill runs.</p><p>“Once every week or every two weeks, do some speed work,&#8221; Krochmal said. &#8220;Warm up for a mile or so, and then start doing pickups.  Run — really run — at 80-90 percent of your maximum speed for a block. Rest for a block, run for a block and continue this for about 10 blocks. At the end, you’ll feel absolutely exhausted, but you’ll have burned so much more fat and calories, and what you’re really doing is increasing your <a href="http://home.hia.no/~stephens/vo2max.htm">VO2 max</a>,&#8221; or the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can transport and utilize during incremental exercise. It&#8217;s a reflection of how physically fit you are.</p><p>As for hills, Illinois is lacking, but you can take advantage of the man-made inclines in Evanston. The small slope on the Lakefill or <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods&#8217;</a> parking ramp (watch for cars!) both work fine. Break up your routine by doing some repeats up any incline you can find. You&#8217;ll definitely feel an improvement in your workout.</p><p>It won&#8217;t take long to realize why so many people run. It&#8217;s so much <em>more </em>than just a way to stay in shape, as Krochmal said: “I’ll tell you &#8212; it’s the best exercise in the planet.&#8221;</p></div><!-- .story-text --><div id="story-bottomsocial"><div class="addthis_toolbox addthis_default_style"><a class="addthis_button_tweet"></a><a class="addthis_button_google_plusone" g:plusone:size="medium"></a><a class="addthis_button_facebook_like" fb:like:layout="button_count"></a></div></div><!-- #story-bottomsocial --><div class="clear"></div></div></div><!-- .box-inside --><div class="box-centerbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-center --><div class="box-right box-story"><div class="box-righttop"></div><div class="box-rightbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-right --></div><!-- .box --><div class="box"><div class="box-left box-storycomments"><div class="box-lefttop"></div><div class="box-leftbottom"></div></div><!-- .box-left --><div class="box-center box-storycomments"><div class="box-centertop"></div><div class="box-inside"><div class="box-heading"><h3>Comments</h3></div><div id="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script type="text/javascript">
