A dancer sends in a haiku each block; we watch his ability to speak coherently deteriorate.<br><br>
Block 1 <br><em>It's really sweaty<br>
How are there nine more of these <br>
Tell mom I love her<br></em><br></br>
Block 2 <br><em>Sweat rains from ceiling<br>
No one has died yet I think<br>
I'm optimistic?<br></em><br></br>
Block 3 <br><em>Body is failing<br>
Must be a way to escape<br>
I despise standing<br></em><br></br>
Block 4 <br><em>Interminable<br>
There's still a fucking day left<br>
How will I survive<br></em><br></br>
Block 5 <br><em>I am sleep dancing<br>
This is called insanity<br>
Free Bobby Shmurda<br></em><br></br>
Block 6 <br><em>I think it's daytime<br>
I have no concept of time<br>
Refrigerator<br></em><br></br>
Block 7 <br><em>Rejuvenation<br>
80s theme did it for me <br>
I should survive now<br></em><br></br>
Block 8 <br><em>Really exhausted<br>
Sandstorm may be illegal<br>
I can see the light<br></em><br></br>
Block 9 <br><em>Strangely energized<br>
Did we really make it here?<br>
Smells like sweat and farts<br></em><br></br>
Block 10 <br><em>Amazing event<br>
I may never stand again<br>
But it was worth it<br></em><br></br></p></div><div id="dm-wall"><h3>The Wall</h3><div><p><strong>DM Blocks</strong></p><p>
