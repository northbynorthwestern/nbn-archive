After everyone gathered inside the tent and the airy feeling inside the tent was once again replaced by steamy claustrophobia, Schapiro took to the stage to give everyone another quick pep talk, peppered with his trademark humor.</p><p>"I slapped a bunch of your hands on the way in," he began. "And it was disgusting!"</p><p>With everyone wearing the same white DM 2013 shirt for the final block, it's become difficult to distinguish dancers from official DM committee members or other supporting visitors. Schapiro's response was to add one of his signature purple sweaters to the mix, wearing it under his DM shirt for fear that "you wouldn't recognize me" without it. But his jokes quickly gave way to a heartfelt salute to the tent's dancers.</p><p>"It's amazing what you're doing ...</p><p><a href="../../story/final-block-kicks-off-with-speeches-from-morty-sta/index.html">Read More...</a></p></div></div><div class="blogrollitem"><div class="blogrollitem-title"><a href="../../story/what-song-saved-you/index.html">What song saved you?</a></div><div class="blogrollitem-info"><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="../../author/sylvanlane/index.html" itemprop="name">Sylvan Lane</a></span>, March 9, 2013

Twenty years ago, O'Neill was busy portraying Al Bundy, the lead role in another ABC sitcom,&nbsp;<em>Married with Children</em>. Both roles involve pretending to read a newspaper. Y'know, like dads do. A few months ago, enterprising Internet navigators pointed out that O'Neill has used the same prop newspaper for both roles. In other words, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ed-oneill-has-been-reading-the-same-newspaper-for-20-years-2012-9" target="_blank">Ed O'Neill has been reading the same newspaper for 20 years</a>!</p><p>2.

Friendships are formed, memories are made and charities are helped.
