The university wanted to expand following World War II, but there was simply not enough space. The solution? Lake Michigan. In 1962, Northwestern started to expand eastward by creating new land off its coastline. When construction finished a few years later, the lakefill we now all know and love had doubled the size of the university&rsquo;s campus.</p><p>But if getting more land was the central issue, why did Northwestern make a big chunk of the lakefill, well, a lake?</p><p>The Lakefill was inaugurated with much pomp and ceremony in October 1964.

Welcome to episode five of Tenny&rsquo;s Tunes! I am your host, Tenny.</p><p>Looking back, we have covered a variety of music, from popular Japanese anime original soundtracks to what I call the genre of online artists. The reason being, so many talented musicians exist on the Internet, showing off their unique styles, that attempting to attribute each one with a specific genre in music history is a tedious, if not impossible, job. Therefore, I thought to myself, why not define online artists in general as a new genre to make our lives easier?</p><p>Okay, I am going off topic. The thing is, I realized we haven&rsquo;t yet discussed what is considered a giant among the genres, and that is classical music. As you might have guessed, my parents and grandparents raised me up as a kid who learned to play classical pieces on the piano, like just about the rest of the ...</p><p><a href="../../story/tennys-tunes-5-rachmaninoff-death-at-19/index.html">Read More...</a></p></div></div><div class="blogrollitem"><div class="blogrollitem-title"><a href="../../story/second-generasian-2-lunar-new-year-special/index.html">Second GenerAsian #2: Lunar New Year Special</a></div><div class="blogrollitem-info"><span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="../../author/daviddeloso/index.html" itemprop="name">David Deloso</a></span>, <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="../../author/hannahjulieyoon/index.html" itemprop="name">Hannah Yoon</a></span>, <span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><a href="../../author/sophialo2/index.html" itemprop="name">Sophia Lo</a></span>, Feb. 4, 2019
