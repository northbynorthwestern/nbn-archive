In August 2009, <i>Wired</i> writer Evan Ratliff shed his identity and tried to disappear. The magazine offered a $5,000 reward to the first person or group to locate Ratliff within a month’s time. He was found 25 days in New Orleans. Ratliff spoke with <i>North by Northwestern</i> about his disappearing act and others who start anew.</p><p><b>Why did you choose to disappear?</b></p><p>I was interested in, basically, the same kind of questions you&#8217;re probably experiencing in this kind of story, which is sort of the interaction between a person&#8217;s real identity and their digital identity. What was behind it all was just a fascination with people who fake their own deaths. I started collecting little stories of people who had gotten caught faking their own deaths for insurance purposes, out from some sort of sentence or fraud, some kind of criminal activity, and my editor and I were looking for a way to tell this story. It seemed like kind of a dumb idea at first &#8211; especially to my editor &#8211; but as we got closer to doing it, everyone in the magazine was excited about doing it, so we thought hopefully there&#8217;d be some sort of audience out there that&#8217;s equally excited about it that would be willing to actually follow me around.</p><p><b>What was the most difficult part of disappearing?</b></p><p>I had the idea that, if you have a digital identity that has some depth to it, if you have a Facebook profile with friends, and you have a Twitter account with people following you, and things like that, it actually gives you this currency in this real world. Normally, when you start on something like Facebook, you just connect with your real friends, and then you add their friends, and then you find your old friends from high school. But if you are an imaginary person and you don&#8217;t have any friends, it&#8217;s kind of difficult to know where to start. I had to basically solicit people who would friend anyone, people with thousands of friends, tens of thousands of friends, who I knew would friend me back.</p><p><b>Why do these people choose to disappear?</b></p><p>I think people get into this state, feeling overwhelmed by the problems that they have, and then they fixate on this solution of, in this case, faking their own death, and it just seems like the answer.</p><p><b>Are there any repercussions legally for someone who creates this fake persona?</b></p><p>I would say, offhand, it doesn&#8217;t seem like that. Prosecutors can use laws in all sorts of interesting ways to prosecute something that isn&#8217;t legally under one law. Fraud laws, you have to lie to someone, you have to do something under false pretenses, and then you actually have to defraud them in some way. You have to benefit at their expense. If they just made a bunch of people feel bad with this big hoax &#8211; It&#8217;s not illegal to lie to people.
</p></div><p>I didn’t know how to say his name and I hadn’t seen his Bieberswept hair around campus. But Syghe, at least according to Facebook, was a Northwestern freshman. So when I logged into Facebook last October and saw his friend request, I clicked confirm.</p><p>“i am an eighteen year old journalism major at northwestern university,” Syghe wrote in his About Me section on Facebook. “i think a lot and sometimes my best thoughts and ideas come when i’m not able to write them down. but other times they turn into thoughts on paper, maybe you’ll get a chance to read them someday…”</p><p>That was about it for me and Syghe L’Oveture (pronounced “Sigh Lay-Oh-Veh-Tur,” I later learned). I never met the guy — never saw his tall, thin frame striding through the leaves or snow. For me, Syghe didn’t really exist until he committed suicide on March 24, 2010.</p><div class="quote_box">“if everyone would just be themselves, we would all be on top of the world. we would all have so much love, so much hope, so much faith. so much understanding. so, tell me. who are you?”— Syghe L’Oveture, manmadearteries. tumblr.com.</div><p>Syghe’s roommate Scott Frazier announced the death on Syghe’s friend’s Facebook account. As spring break ended and students returned to Evanston, Syghe quietly didn’t. But neither the school nor The Daily Northwestern had anything to say about the tragedy.</p><p>Had the L’Oveture family asked to keep the death quiet? The Northwestern directory didn’t list a Syghe L’Oveture. Syghe’s Twitter and his Tumblr, titled “manmadearteries,” had disappeared. Days after his death, someone deleted Syghe’s Facebook account. It had been our only real connection.</p><p>Syghe had found me online, so that’s where I went to discover the truth about his death. The obvious place to start was Syghe’s temporary memorial page on Legacy.com, an obituary site.</p><p>I checked out the biography portion of the memorial, apparently written by Syghe’s family. The list of Syghe’s survivors included his parents, Tracey and David L’Oveture; his grandmothers, Paulina Crewsel and Isabel L’Oveture; six nieces and nephews, five aunts and uncles and four cousins. Most of these people didn’t exist, according to Google, and I couldn’t link Syghe to the more common names that did.</p><p>Between the godmothers and the cousins, Syghe’s family included Scott Frazier, “his best friend.” Soon after Syghe’s death, someone deleted Frazier’s Facebook account. Like Syghe, Frazier didn’t exist in the Northwestern directory.</p><p>I talked with Erica (last name withheld at source’s request), a Northwestern Communication sophomore, about Frazier. Erica was the only one of Syghe’s few friends in the Northwestern network who knew him as more than a name.</p><p>Erica had kept a Facebook message thread with Syghe, though they never met in person. “Something would always come up in a way that we could never end up hanging out,” Erica said. “He would never follow through on giving me his number.”</p><div class="quote_box" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 10px">“be truthful. be open. be honest. be loyal. be accepting. be loving. be everything that really matters, and nothing that doesn’t…we’re all in these things together.”— Syghe L’Oveture, manmadearteries. tumblr.com.</div><p>Syghe told Erica that he lived in Allison, though she couldn’t find him or his roommate. “There were videos on Facebook of him being like, ‘Hey, this is my friend Scott,’” Erica said. Maintaining one fake identity would have been an exhausting charade. Did the man behind the mask also create a roommate to back up his lies?</p><p>The internet, of course, is full of people who want to talk. Syghe had been an online hero — the father of a deeply devoted Tumblr family. Users Kaylee, Krystine, Daphnee and Matthew led a slew of frequent admirers. They all knew each other through Syghe, brought together by his lowercase platitudes and obsession with astronomy, Manchester Orchestra and <em>(500) Days of Summer</em>.</p><p>“Rest in peace, Syghe,” posted Kaylee (last name withheld due to age), a fiery-haired 15 year old from California. “I never met you, but you changed my life.”</p></div><div id="page2" class="pagebreak"><p>Even friends of friends felt the reverberations. Twenty-year old Michelle Lynn from Massachusetts started fundraising for suicide prevention on Tumblr because Syghe had “pulled [her friend Krystine] through her own troubles only weeks ago.”</p><p>Michelle’s friend, Krystine Lovett, was the first to speak with me. Lovett keeps the post where Syghe first approached her on a separate Tumblr.</p><p>“although we aren’t very close,” Syghe wrote, “nor have we had a full on conversation, i just wanted to apologize on behalf of everything you are going through and on behalf of whoever caused it…there are plenty of other people who love you. including us, your internet friends. you deserve to be happy.”</p><p>Lovett posted about Syghe and her feelings for him almost daily after the death. “I really think he is the most caring friend I’ve ever had, and it’s really hard to deal with,” Lovett wrote in an email after his death. “Wishful thinking, but maybe he’s still alive!”</p><p>In May, it appeared Lovett’s wish had came true.</p><p>“It’s not so often you’re handed a second chance. I never thought I’d get this opportunity, ever,” Lovett wrote. “This was unexpected to say the least, but I’m beyond happy to have you in my life.”</p><div class="quote_box">“i asked who you are. i don’t want an explanation. i want a conversation.”— Syghe L’Oveture, manmadearteries. tumblr.com.</div><p>Around that time, Krystine stopped responding to my emails and started posting comments meant to dissuade sources from speaking with me. Just as Krystine wasn’t the only girl who wouldn’t talk, though, she also wasn’t the only girl who had given her heart to a stranger.</p><p>“His name is Syghe :) He’s coming to see me for 6 days in February ^_^,” blogged Daphnee Ochoa, a visual and performing arts sophomore at Syracuse University. The note ran below a photo of Syghe singing onstage. Ochoa posted it on her Tumblr on Jan. 8, adding the caption, “Full possession of my heart.”</p><p>Twelve days later, Ochoa was using a different set of emoticons.</p><p>“THAT’S SUCH BULLSHIT,” she titled her post. “First you get ‘sick’ and have to leave &#8211; right after I talk to you about leaving a video on my wall so I could have proof. Then you say you’d be back by Monday and I have nothing to worry about because you’d leave me a video when you got back, but, NOW YOU’RE IN HAITI WITH YOUR MOM AND DAD HELPING OUT? LOL, you must seriously have me pegged for a dumbass or something. So fucking through. This is the third strike. I’m done.”</p><p>I didn’t know the full story behind Ochoa’s rage until October, when she put up a post on the perils of online friendship (Ochoa did not respond to interview requests for this story).</p><p>“About two years ago I developed a pretty good connection with somebody I thought was real &#8211; over the internet. We talked all the time, and even when I had my doubts I’d get reassurance from him,” Ochoa wrote. “Syghe (‘his’ name) would let me know that I was being paranoid and then he even gave me proof that he was, in fact, real. And then one day somebody sent me a link to a page &#8211; and it was all photos of him… with a different name attached.”</p><p>A week after Ochoa’s retrospective, I spoke with Kaylee, the 15-year-old from California. Like everyone else, Kaylee met Syghe online. “I was really intrigued with everything he said, wrote, posted&#8230; everything,” she wrote via email. “he was just so fascinating and thoughtful, and, well, perfect.”</p><p>After the death, Kaylee had done her own Veronica Mars sleuthing. She filled in some of the background around Ochoa. “He made a video saying his name…and Daphnee’s name to prove he was real. But the video was private on YouTube, so I couldn’t see it.”</p><p>After our interview, Kaylee shared all of her materials. At the bottom of her email were two links I had never seen before.</p><p>The first led to a Tumblr named “The Perfect Shade of Green.” The blog was full of posts and photos, song lyrics and videos. The next link led to the About Me page and a photo of the blogger, a man named Joseph Farrugia.</p><p>The picture was of Syghe.</p></div><div id="page3" class="pagebreak"><div class="quote_box">“look in the mirror. look past the clothes and the makeup. look past the hair and the teeth. look past everything you see on the outside. search yourself for what you feel. what you see when you close your eyes.”— Syghe L’Oveture, manmadearteries. tumblr.com.</div><p>Farrugia is an 18-year-old at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario. He studies earth science and physics. He said he’s close with his two siblings. He’s never heard of Manchester Orchestra.</p><p>In a Skype interview earlier this month, Farrugia confirmed that the photos of Syghe are from his Facebook. “When I first started my Facebook, I wasn’t really careful with who I was adding,” Farrugia said. “I have over a thousand [friends] and I know half of them.”</p><p>”I don’t see what makes me so special,” he said. “Why me? Why would they pick my face?”</p><p>Farrugia is special, though. Between 2007 and 2009, Farrugia was in Hasket, an Ontario band that became “really locally famous.” Isn’t the Tumblr dreamboat a shaggy-haired, dark-eyed rock star? And whoever chose Farrugia couldn’t have missed that the University of Western Ontario’s school colors are purple and white – perfect for pretending Farrugia’s Facebook photos were those of a Northwestern student.</p><p>As for Scott, the man does exist. But he wasn’t Syghe’s roommate – he was Farrugia’s friend from high school. “I know that video, actually. It was taken from my classroom,” Farrugia said. “I sent it right on Facebook.” Kaylee had discovered that Syghe had adopted at least three more of Farrugia’s friends to fake digital identities for so he could tag them in photos with him.</p><p>When I asked about Ochoa’s video, Farrugia grew visibly upset.</p><p>Farrugia said he received a Facebook message in January from a man named Mitch Cooper, who asked him to record a video for his 15-year-old sister. Cooper said his sister had cancer and didn’t have much time left. An organization called “Sigh” functioned as the “Make A-Wish” program at her hospital, allegedly, and Cooper’s sister only had one request: “can you make her a video saying ‘hey Daphne it’s sigh and I hope you’re happy now.’”</p><div class="quote_box" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px; margin-left: 10px;">“who you are is not what you wear. it’s not the car you drive. it’s not the latest trends. who you are is not the music you listen to or the books you read. maybe that doesn’t leave you much to work with, does it?”— Syghe L’Oveture, manmadearteries. tumblr.com.</div><p>Joe recorded the video and sent it to Mitch on Jan. 23. Ochoa saw the video and gave Syghe a second chance. Well, at least until she figured everything out again.</p><p>Was Mitch Cooper the man behind Syghe L’Oveture? Perhaps. Mitch goes by the name Richie Payne on Facebook now. Maybe Richie is another sidekick, like Scott Frazier. Or maybe Mitch, now Richie, is the new Syghe, reaching out and building his cast for the next great fall.</p><p>It’s very possible that the person behind Syghe has moved to a different body. Emails between Syghe devotees Matthew and Kaylee revealed that Matthew first met Syghe through a Myspace group in 2009. Back then, Syghe was using the face of a man named Dan Zamora.</p><p>The group found out that the pictures weren’t real, but Matthew didn’t care. “The only fake thing were his photos, not his personality or attitude. He was still himself underneath a layer of someone else.” When Syghe killed his accounts in March, Matthew didn’t know that Syghe, too, was a ruse.</p><p>Resolution seemed to arrive in an email from Krystine Lovett in October, almost a year after Syghe first friended me. Lovett, who had turned cold toward me after reconnecting with Syghe post-mortem, was ready to talk again.</p><p>“His name is actually Landon,” wrote Lovett. “He’s just an insecure, nineteen year old boy from California with a desire to fit in somewhere. In his case, it was the internet. He hid his true identity to provide some anonymity and it spiraled out of control, which is where his ‘death’ comes in.”</p><p>She included a portion of an email he sent to her. In it, Landon described himself as a wealthy teenager tired of his family’s extravagance. Landon, according to the letter, is 6-feet tall and got his braces off five months ago. His interests match up with Syghe’s, and he thinks “people are really interesting.”</p><p>“My name is not syghe austen l’oveture. never has been, never will be,” the author wrote. “this lying stuff is really juvenile so i’m done and coming clean. i know it doesn’t really matter, however for what it’s worth, i am truly sorry.”</p><p>Is Landon real? Or is Lovett another of Syghe’s accomplices? One thing is clear: Whoever is behind the Syghe incarnations knows how to move people. Whether that’s because his teenage innocence is pure and honest, or because he’s a puppetmaster of the highest degree, I still don’t know Syghe L’Oveture.</p><p id="player1" style="display:none"><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">Get the latest Flash Player</a> to see this player.</p><noscript><p>[Javascript required to view Flash movie, please turn it on and refresh this page]</p></noscript><script type="text/javascript">
